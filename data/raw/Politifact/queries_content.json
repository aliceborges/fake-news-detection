How about Ted Kennedy ? 300 of his bills became law ; plus , he co-sponsored 550 more that became law . At his current rate of legislative success , Bernie Sanders would have to serve 2,500 more years in the Senate to match Kennedy ! Hardly encouraging . In his entire 25 year legislative career , Sanders has done nothing of real consequence in either the House or the Senate .

Powell did all his email business on a private account . All of his emails on official business were apparently in a private account . It is not clear why a great deal of what is said against Clinton's emails , could not be said against Powell's . Moreover , Powell's similar practices can hardly be blamed on his being a novice about security . He not only had been Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , he had been National Security Adviser . He had jurisdiction over all the intelligence agencies . Since Powell , with unimpeachable security credentials , felt fine using private email for official business , why are we climbing all over Clinton ? It is , to be blunt , a double standard ."

They want to know what the words \" extreme vetting \" mean . Can you tell us ? GIULIANI : Extreme vetting means that from countries that house terrorists , countries from which attacks on the United States have been launched , there is going to be a very , very strict test in order to get into the United States . You don't have a right to come to the United States . There's no such right to come to the United States . So , we should be taking in people who believe in us , who believe in what we believe in , and who are dedicated to the principle ofa nation of laws , not Sharia law but American law , and from certain countries where we've had problems it's going to be pretty hard to get in . And it should be . For example , taking in Syrian refugees , which Hillary Clinton wants to increase by 550 percent , that's 5.5 times more than Obama has brought in . She wants to be the Angela Merkel of the U . S . ISIS has told us they are going to put terrorist operatives in with those Syrian refugees . They've actually told us . Now , we would have to be stupid to allow them to come into the United States . We would have to be out of our minds . What we should do is set up a no fly zone in Syria and put them there . Keep them in their country so they're not flooding Germany . Look at how crime has gone up in Germany since they've allowed Syrian refugees in . All of a sudden , you had terror attacks in three or four different places in Germany . So , we don't want thatto happen in the United States . We have enough home grown problems than to bring in a bunch of Syrian refugees I'm sure many of whom are legitimate people , but we've been told they are going to hide terrorists with them ."

Other related versions of this theory alleged that Obama was educated in an Indonesian \" madrassa \" or steeped in Islamist ideology from a young age , and the theories began to spread virally after Obama appeared on the national stage \" to the casual observer , from nowhere \" with his early 2007 presidential campaign announcement . ( See : Obama kin : Birther rumors ' a shame ' ) All through that year , the Obama campaign - with the affirmation of most leaders of both parties - aggressively battled that smear by emphasizing his Christian faith . Obama's controversial but emphatically Christian pastor emerged as a campaign issue and the belief that he was a Muslim seemed to lose traction . ( See : Clinton : Birther claims ' ludicrous ' ) Then , as Obama marched toward the presidency , a new suggestion emerged : That he was not eligible to serve . ( See : Birther debate alive across U . S . That theory first emerged in the spring of 2008 , as Clinton supporters circulated an anonymous email questioning Obama's citizenship ."

Even the MSNBC show Morning Joe admits that it was Clinton's henchmen who first raised this issue , not Donald J . Trump . In 2011 , Mr . Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate . Mr . Trump did a great service to the President and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised . Inarguably , Donald J . Trump is a closer . Having successfully obtained President Obama's birth certificate when others could not , Mr . Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States . Mr .

        "text_for_the_image": "Hillary and the Tlming of Obama's Birth Certificate Issue ( VANITY ] posted on pty @user Now that Drudge has a link to the BC issue , it should go viral . Why is all this coming out now , right before time to gear up for 2012 campaigns ? Tinfoil Hat Mode : ON Hillary and Obama may have made a deal back during the 2008 campaign . Hillary couldn't pull the rug out from under Obama with the birth certificate issue , because she would lose the black vote then and forever ; thus Hillary would never be POTUS . Instead , she became Secretary of State , a position that she could distance herself from Obama . Keeping Hillary out of the VP slot also prevented her from pulling out the BC to take over the presidency sooner when and if the BC issue was raised . Obama was supposed to only be a one term POTUS , but Hillary and O's socialist policies were so unpopular that it became doubtful that she could pull off a win in 2012 . Even if she did , she probably would not regain the House and might still lose the Senate . The Republicans have refused to raise the issue knowing the repercussions with the minority vote , even with plenty of liberals and Hillary supporters taking over Conservative sites to lead the way . What do do ? Obama must pretend to run for a second term while Hillary claims all the while she is content as SOS and has no plans to run for 2012 . The birth certificate must be brought to the forefront , but blame must be placed on the \" evil racist \" Conservatives , such as those in Arizona that will to force the issue by making Obama show his BC before being allowed on the 2012 ballot . To prevent any blame possibly being placed on Hillary , a solid Obama supporter must be found to \" accidentally \" bring out the issue , but the racists must run with it . The Governor of Hawaii fit the bill as he was an Obama delegate in the 2008 election . If public outrage , or at least minority outrage is high enough at the Arizona \" racists \" and their ilk ( Can we say TEAParty ) that are trying to block Obama from running , then Hillary could possibly pull off a Trifecta POTUS , take back the House , and keep the Senate . After all , we can't have racists blocking the presidency of the black Messiah , can we ? All this conjecture , Of course , depends upon Obama not having a birth certificate and we Conservatives allowing Hill , DNC , et all to get away with dumping the blame on us ."

Overwhelmingly this will save African-American and Hispanic lives , citizens who are entitled to the same protection as every other American . [ CHEERS ] Every other American . You know , I say , when I look at these inner cities , and I see how bad they are , the crime is through the roof , the education is horrible , there are no jobs , black youth - it's what's happening . And remember that Hillary Clinton calls them super predators . Right ? Super predators ! That was her term . Super predators ! But you look at African-American youth with unemployment rates in the fifties , and I say to people the poverty is at numbers that you wouldn't believe . And I say what do you have to lose ? I'll fix it . I say this to African-American communities . What do you have to lose ? Donald Trump is going to fix it . We're gonna fix it . we're gonna make it safe . [ CHEERS ] They can't walk down the street . In many cases , they get shot . They get shot . Their children get shot and killed . And it's so sad . I will fix it . Just give me a chance . [ CHEERS ] I also explained last night that stop-and-frisk is constitutional . The MC is arguing with me taking up a lot of time . In fact , law enforcement conducts stop-and-frisk in cities every day . You have to do this ! You have to do this . In Chicago , 3000 shootings since January ISt of this year . 3,000 ! Of course you have to do it ! It's based on the Supreme Court ruling - Terry vs . Ohio from 1968 . Improving law enforcement is a matter of life and death and even survival for our country ."

Clinton cited Gore's role in helping turn around the NAF - TA fight with his debate against Ross Perot on CNNs \" Larry King Live , \" calling it a \" magic moment . \" Taking note of the negotia - tions in Geneva to wrap up a long-sought world trade deal , Clinton called on countries to \" seize this moment and close the deal . \" Over the weekend , Clinton revealed just how far behind he had once been , saying he was more than 100 House votes short in September when he launched a NAFTA offensive with allies including Rep . Bill Richardson , D-N . M .

Still nursing their wounds from the rancorous debate , labor leaders have decided to wait until next year before dol ing out contributions to Demo . cratic candidates for Congress . Teamsters Union President Ron Carey said the decision is meant to serve notice that the Democrats expect loyalty on other issues . \" Of course it is a warning sign , \" he said Tuesday . \" Our reaction to the whole NAFTA fight was a warning . \" Myers on Tuesday sought to play down the rift , saying Clin - ton plans to work with labor on a number of issues next year , including worker retraining , reforms Of the Occupational Safety and Health Act and Striker replacement legislation .

With Republican government austerity I'd choose a private server to host these emails over a government server , which she did . The servers were professionally managed and operated .

Both Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell used non-state department email . Private servers with better security were next and you can't post date classified documents . I find it funny that not one Republican batted an eye when George W . Bush lost 22 million emails including pre-IRAQ war intelligence from an RNC private server or Mitt Romney sold the governments server when he was done @user"

WikiLeaks has exposed Chinese censorship blacklists . WikiLeaks has released 2.3 million emails exposing Assad's regime . The US Director of National Intelligence , James Clapper , himself confirmed that as far as the US intelligence agencies are concerned , there is no evidence that Russia is the source for the DNC leaks , and that media speculation that Russia might be behind the DNC leaks amounted to \" hyperventilation \" . This hyperventilation , combined with an attempt to attack WikiLeaks ' independence , serves to distract from the wrongdoing revealed in the DNC leaks namely subverting the democratic process in nominating the Democratic presidential candidate .

An unclassified October 7 , 2016 joint DNI-DHS statement on this issue said the hacks are consistent with the methods and motivations Of Russian-directed efforts .

Such activity is not new to Moscow \" the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europa and Eurasia , for example , to influence public opinion there .

Without electoral college California would decide every election which wouldn't be good either . But if Trump had cared about popular vote all he had to do is spend time / money in California , and flip 800K Also there is no way Jill Stem received so few votes so CA voting machine probably were rigged . BT \\ N if there were 1-3 million dead people and undocumented voters for Hillary there were also 1-3 million folks purged from voter rolls who would have voted for her probably so those 2 are a wash . The difference would have been the voting machines being rigged ( like they did In primary ) but since Obama and Hillary were whining about Russia cheating , there were DHS FBI folks watching those machines and Hillary couldn't cheat enough to win this time in swing states . It is also not like 2000 where electoral was gore 266 ( with 500K more votes ) bush 271 , where just ONE STATE would have made all the difference . This time Trump had a landslide 290 ( 302 after Michigan is counted ) to Hillary 228 She would have had to switch 3 states or more . Or instead of California having 55 electoral votes , you'd have to give it like 75 more or 130 . I don't necessarily like the electoral college or winner take all , we should have proportional representation or switch to referendum government . But Trump absolutely crushed Hillary , we need to just face that and move on . BT \\ N if Hillary is allowed to whine about popular vote versus electoral , and we have a do over , that is fine but we also need to have a ' do over ' on the primary WITHOUT super elegates _ I will agree to that But as told us over and over ' this is the system we got ' or ' you knew the system before we started ' _ So the should STOP WHINING , they have given us Trump so let's make the best of it We need to stop reps and Trump from doing anything stupid for 2 years and flip the congress In 2018 With ONLY progressives . Weed out all corporatists . BT \\ N Trump helped stop TPP already . We all want a big Infrastructure project Trump looks like he will stop wars overseas .

This system leaves minority voters in Georgia with no voice whatsoever in the final real election . Thus , if the election is viewed by the State as a statewide election , then Electors should be allocated proportionately , in order to give every vote equal dignity and weight , thereby electing a delegation of Electors that actually represents all of the voters within the State . Under this methodology every vote counts . Proportional allocation of Electors respects the one man one vote principle while preserving the small state bias . It merely eliminates the likelihood of a President being elected who did not win the popular vote and did not win because of the small State bias embedded in the Constitution ."

In this election Trump won the vote in States providing 306 Electors with approximately 40,000 , 000 votes or approximately thirty percent ( 30 % ) of the total national vote of approximately 134,000 , 000 . In fact he could have won those states with several million fewer votes than the 40,000 , 000 votes he received . From the standpoint of practical reality , although Trump received approximately 62,500 , 000 votes in total , he did not need to receive a single additional vote to win the election . None of the votes in the States won by Clinton played any role in the outcome of the election . I may be going too far into the weeds here , but to illustrate how extreme a result the winner-take-all allocation of Electors could lead to , it would be possible to win the presidency by winning the vote in 37 of the 40 states with the smallest population , including DC ( losing any 3 of the jurisdictions with only 3 Electoral votes ) . These \" small States \" would have approximately 45 % of the total US population in aggregate . Assuming that there are only two candidates , that voters in each of the 50 States vote in the same approximate percentages and that the Electors from each of these small States are allocated on a winner-take-all basis , then the theoretical minimum vote to assure victory would be fifty percent ( 50 % ) plus one of the votes cast in each of these small States , or 22.6 % of the national vote total .

We are on board a ship at sea . The owners Of the ship have hired a captain to chart a course to the destination they have chosen . We unfortunate souls on board the ship may complain about the food being serve up in the galley , or we may complain about the sleeping arrangements . We may even be able , if we try hard enough and are willing to take the risks , to obtain some improvements in those areas . But we have no control over the destination or the course the ship is sailing . I don't doubt that the Clintons and the Bushes are , like all the others before them and those who will follow them , bought and paid for by wealthy interests who view the rest Of us as disposable property . However , even on slave ships , some captains were more \" human \" than others . I think the common person gets a better measure Of justice under a liberal than today's conservatives . Today's conservatives allow us only the crumbs that fall on the floor . The liberal will occasionally throw a crumb or two on the floor . When we compare the Clinton administration with that Of either Bush , or even Ronald Reagan , it is obvious that Hillary is the better choice . Better to have Machiavelli's amoral prince than Eric Hoffer's true believer . As C . S . Lewis said , it is better to be tortured by a sadist than one who believes he hears the voice of God whispering in his ear . \" Paul Waibel , Mississippi"

That way you are able to increase taxes , and this will produce more poverty . 4 ) Gun Control--Remove people's ability to defend themselves from the Government .

As for the health care , Ido admit that there are major flaws in play aut right now they are trying to repeal the ACA without having anything else in place The only thing that repealing it will do is kick the people who are on itoff R will also allow insurance companies to cut cm.erage to all who are on it create a higher premium for women , not have to provide for preventative care including but not limited to cancer screenings , and is likely to cause prices to skyrocket ay only giving a block grant to each state , without regard as to paying more for new , better treatments , more people on medicare / medicaid during the grant time , and other reasons to adjust it , health care will be even skimpier and mora spread out with more cases like yours . The \" donut hole \" for Medicare is likely to get even bigger , with people having to pay more out of pocket as tha state will have less money to cover individuals So before you get excited about the repeal of \" obamacare \" please realize that it will harm many people , and will likely not help out in pour situation . At least , that is for repealing it right now with nothing else in place Also , rm not one to dwell on the past , but it is worth noting , a lotofwhat was in the original bill for the ACA was cut outto be able to get it to pass . twas not meantto ba an end all , perfect solution , just something to get the foot in the door for affordable health care for all So feel your comment to be incredibly judgmental and I encourage pou to read the links you share before you post them , and also to read up on what repealing the policies will actually do for url Jrepealing-the ..

It then steadily dropped , to 7-4 in 1996 , to 6.1 in 2006 , to 4-4 in 2014 . It went up in 2015 to 4-9 . But that is less than half the murder rate of 1980 , while the population has risen from 226 million in 1980 to 321 million in 2015 . The violent crime rate in America also has plummeted over the years . Defined as including murder , rape , robbery and aggravated assault , violent crimes peaked at a rate of 758 per 100,000 residents in 1991 , and the rate was about 373 violent crimes per 100,000 in 2015 , again a decline of more than half ."

The 9th Circuit has a well-earned reputation for being presumptively reversible . Unlike the district court order , there is at least a court opinion which can be evaluated . Of particular interest is the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ' suggestion that even those unlawfully present in the country have certain due process rights with respect to immigration . The Court cites Zadwdas v . Davis , 533 U . S . 678 , 695 ( 2001 ) for the proposition that even aliens who have committed and been convicted of certain crimes while in the U . S . unlawfully may have due process rights with respect to travel to or from the United States . In addition , the Court ventures curiously into its own role in reviewing a President's national security conclusions . Legal permanent residents , non-citizens with current valid visas , non-citizens with expired visas ( which were once valid ) , aliens with no legal standing , aliens who have committed a crime but have not yet been deported and aliens who are not even present in the United States but seek to come are just a few of the categories the Supreme Court will need to determine what process is due , if any . It seems clear to most of us - not on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals - there is no right to come to this country for non-citizens of the United States . It also seems clear judges are neither in a position , practically or jurisprudentially , to second guess national security determinations made by the Commander in Chief . There is a reason we elect the Commander in Chief and do not elect federal judges . For those , like Alexander Hamilton , who once or now wondered if the Judicial Branch would be too weak . Wonder no more . '"

We were hundreds of billions of dollars over budget . Seven years late , great plane . A great plane . So think of it . They're seven years late . Hundreds of billions of dollars over-budget . Other than that by the way the project is going extremely well . And I got the folks in from Lockheed Martin who are terrific people and a terrific product by the way . I also got Boeing in . I said do me a favor , give me a competing offer . And now they're competing and fighting and we've gotten hundreds of millions of dollars off the price of a plane that was going to be ordered , in other words , if my opponent got in , there would have been no calls made to them . They would have signed contracts . So they're going to make plenty of money , but it's going to be a lot less than they would have made without Trump . That I can tell you .

While the 2014 statistics ( the latest available ) for Germany are of interest , they fail to capture any effect that the approximately one million refugees and asylum seekers who arrived in country in 201 5 may have had on crime . According to the very latest available statistics for Berlin , speciflcally the first quarter of 201 5 , there were significant increases in a number of crime categories over 2014 . These increases included : drug related crime 19 percent ; pickpocketing 24 percent ; homicide 33 percent ; and burglary 43 percent . Although more recent statistics have yet to be made available , police report there were significant increases in some crimes such as burglary and pickpocketing Berlin in 2015 compared to 2014 . Visiting American tourists and expatriates have been infrequent victims of crime . Occasionally , Americans have had purses snatched and pockets picked in high trafflc and tourist areas ( e . g . , in train stations , Internet cafes , crowded restaurants , and outdoor market places ) , but violent crimes against Americans have been relatively infrequent . While personal assaults do occur , there is no reason to believe these crimes are driven by anti-American sentiment , but are rather the result of opportunity"

You remember when Vice President Joe Biden's youngest son , Hunter Biden , joined the board of directors of Ukraine's largest oil company ? Do you remember that one ? Oh , you don't remember that story ? Why don't you remember it ? Because the fake news business didn't approve it . They didn't run with it . Did they ever say to Joe Biden : \" Ukraine , Mr .

Dan Walters , a respected columnist for the Sacramento Bee , has estimated that the state's unfunded liabilities are between $ 500 billion and $ 1 trillion .

Of course . That's why he's stationed in Washington . Our ambassador in Moscow serves the same function . It's called diplomacy and advocacy . Kushner also met with a Russian banker , Sergey Gorkov , the head of Vnesheconombank , which is the subject of U . S . sanctions .

Neither is it a crime to collude with a forei n overnment to influence an election . explained in a recent column , there is no criminal statute prohibiting it . President Trump insists there was no collusion . But even if there was , it is not unlawful . The lawyer for Jared Kushner says he is prepared to answer any and all questions .

The research organization Just Facts , a Widely cited , independent think tank led by self - described conservatives and libertarians , revealed number-crunching in a report on national immigration . Just Facts President James D . Agresti and his team looked at data from an extensive Harvard'Y 0uGOV study that every two years questions a sample size Of tens Of thousands of voters . Some acknowledge they are noncitizens and are thus ineligible to Just Facts ' conclusions confront both sides in the illegal voting debate : those who say it happens a lot and those who say the problem nonexistent .

In the 1910s , the Terra Nova Expedition recorded that killer whales had attempted to tip ice floes on which an expedition photographer and a sled dog team were standing . On June 15 , 1972 , 43 - foot-long ( 13 m ) wooden schooner Lucette ( Lucy ) was holed by a pod of killer whales and sank approximately 200 miles west Of the Galapagos Islands . The group Of six people aboard escaped to an inflatable life raft and a sol id-hull dinghy . On September 9 , 1972 , a Californian surfer named Hans Kretschmer reported being bitten by a killer whale at Point Sur . His wounds required 100 stitches . In August 2005 , while swimming in four feet of water in Helm Bay , near Ketchikan , Alaska , a 12 - year-old boy named Ellis Miller was \" bumped \" in the shoulder by a 25 - foot transient killer whale . The boy was not injured . During the filming Of the third episode Of the BBC documentary \" Frozen Planet \" ( 2011 ) , a group Of orcas were filmed trying to \" wave wash \" the Film crew's 18 - foot zodiac boat as they were filming . The crew had earlier taped the group hunting seals in the same fashion . It was not mentioned if any Of the crew were hurt in the encounter ."

In AO 2014-20 ( Make Your Laws PAC ) , the Commission concluded . a political action committee could accept assistance from foreign national in developing intellectual property for the PAC . such as trademarks , graphics , and website design because the services accepted by the PAC would fall under the volunteer exemption . Similarly , in AO 2004-26 ( Weller ) , the Commission held that a foreign national could attend , speak at campaign events for a federal candidate , and solicit contributions to the campaign . However , the Commission cautioned that the foreign national could not manage or participate in any ofthe campaign committee's decision-making processes .

This package includes important reforms like eliminating the job-killing employer mandate and the requirement that forces people to purchase coverage they don't want . Still it is not enough to solve the many failures of Obamacare . Senators have made clear that this is an effort to keep the process alive , not to make law . If moving forward requires a conference committee , that is something the House is willing to do . The reality , however , is that repealing and replacing Obamacare still ultimately requires the Senate to produce 51 votes for an actual plan . The House remains committed to finding solution and working with our Senate colleagues , but the burden remains on the Senate to demonstrate that it is capable of passing something that keeps our promise , as the House has already done , until the Senate can do that , we will never be able to develop a conference report that becomes jaw . We expect the Senate to act first on whateverthe conference committee produces . Obamacare is collapsing and hurting Amencan families . We have to keep working at this until we get the job done . \""

Highlights of his iife include : 1891 Prof . of Military Science and Tactics Univer . of Nebraska 1898 Serves in the Spanish-American War 1901 Awarded rank of Captain 1906 Promoted to rank ot Brigadier General 1909 Military Governor of Moro Province , Philippines 1916 Made Major General 1919 PromNed to General of the Armies 1921 Appointed Chief of Staff 1924 Retires from active duty Education West Point . Just before World War l , there were a number of terrorist attacks on the United States forces in the Philippines by Muslim extremists . So General Pershing captured 50 terrorists and had them tied to posts for execution . He then had his men bring in two pigs and slaughter them in front of the now horrified terrorists . Muslims detest pork because they believe pigs are filthy animals . Some of them simply refuse to eat it , while others won't even touch pigs at all , nor any of their by-products . To them , eating or touching a pig , its meat , its blood , etc . , is to be instantly barred from paradise ( and those virgins ) and doomed to hell .

The proposed limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment , hinder the advance of science and technology , and damage the health and welfare of mankind . There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide , methane , or other greenhouse gases is causing or will , in the foreseeable future , cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate .

When a pilot wants to be a show off , with a \" wet start \" his engine start creates a large startling flame and lots of surprise noise from the rear of a jet engine on start up . McCain did the \" Wet Start \" . It was not an accident . The flames from the wet start torched off the launching of a powerful Zuni rocket on the plane behind him . The Zuni rockets were famous for having electrical problems . It shot across the carrier's deck hitting other parked planes that were packing 1,000 high - explosive pound bombs . This caused the bombs to explode . The subsequent massive explosions , fire and destruction went several decks below and nearly sunk this major 82,000 ton U . S . aircraft carrier . This stunt and aftermath caused the death of 134 sailors and blew off arms , legs , and caused blindness and burns to another 161 sailors . McCain jumped from his plane , rolled across the flames , and escaped . He watched the men dying and the burning from a closed circuit television on the ship . Sadly all of those lives were lost . They had to take the ship off the battle line for 2 years when it had to be taken back to port for $ 76 million dollars of extensive repairs . That does not include the cost of replacing the airplanes or ammunition ."

McCain had graduated from the Naval Academy . Witnesses say the good ole boy Navy tradition went into high gear immediately . McCain was not even repremanded . When there is a cover-up , the soldier is usually simply assigned to another ship . McCain was quietly assigned to another ship . There is an ongoing debate about the incident to this day . John McCain's lack of character was further demonstrated when he voted not to repeal Obamacare . He had run his 2016 Senatorial race under the banner he would LEAD the fight to repeal Obamacare . He hates Donald Trump so very much he gleefully held his thumb down for his vote rather than a thumbs up . He laughed afterwards and said , \" Let's see Donald Trump save America now ! \" What a horrible man . He stabbed his constituents and the citizens of America in the back .

Here are economic and demographic trends white men have created for themselves . Wiite men account for 69 % of violent crimes . The death rate from drugs in white males has risen 25 fold since 1980 . The work rate for adult men has plunged 13 percentage points in a half-century . For the first time ever the life expectancy of white males has declined . Women now outnumber men in college . Oh , and literally every mass murder was done by a white guy . I don't make up the numbers . So , we really do have a white guy problem . Unless we give the cranky useless babies some thing to do , they will apparently continue to shoot everyone for fun . Edit"

Cummings Ranking Member Committee on Oversight and Government Reform U . S . House of Representatives Washington , D . C . 20515 Dear Ranking Member Cummings : COMM'NGS The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Committee on the Judiciary have primary jurisdiction over the matters you refer to in today's letter . Earlier this year , I specifically communicated to Special Counsel Robert Mueller I would not wittingly or unwittingly interfere with an ongoing criminal probe . What you allege is a crime , squarely within the jurisdiction of the Special Counsel . You claim to have already had ex parte communications with Mueller's office . If you have evidence of a crime , you should provide it to the Special Counsel immediately . The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence is not investigating crime on a \" daily \" basis but rather investigating the following as part of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election : Russian cyber activity and Other \" active measures \" directed against the U . S . and its allies ; Counterintelligence concerns related to Russia and the 2016 U . S . election , including any intelligence regarding links between Russia and individuals associated with political campalgns ; The United States Government's response to these Russian active measures and any impact they may have on intelligence relationships and traditional alliances ; and Possible leaks of classified information related to the Intelligence Community's assessments Of these matters . As for your continued obsession with the Select Committee on Benghazi , the Federal Bureau of Investigation's investigation began as a direct result of the Committee's work which led to the discovery of the email server . The Committee held no hearings on the matter and interviewed no witnesses other than to determine whether the Committee had all relevant information . Perhaps your memory is poor because you spent two years obstructing , delaying , and obfuscating the investigation . If it had been up to you , the server would still be a mystery ."

In 2009 , a left wing radical Islamic sympathizer Major Nidal Hasan fatally snot 13 people and injured more than 30 others on Fort Hood , near Killeen , Texas . The snooting produced more casualties than any other on an American military base . In 2010 a mentally ill registered Democrat named Jared Lee Loughner , shot Rep . Gabrielle Giffords in the head thus wounding her for life . In 2011 a registered Democrat named James Holmes , went into a movie theater and shot and killed 12 people .

Because those who chose not to have their personal information listed in the phone book now have their residences exposed to a worldwide audience on the Internet . It now means that people who kept low profiles and their addresses private because they have been victims of stalkers or domestic violence are now easier targets for stalkers and other sociopaths . The dangers of gun registration were demonstrated in Europe in the mid - 20th century . Gun registration laws had been enacted by democratic governments , such as the Weimar Republic in Germany , and the Third Republic in France . The lists fell into the hands of the Nazis , first in Germany and then in all the countries they conquered . In Germany , guns were confiscated from the Jews and from anyone else who was not considered to be an utterly obedient servant of the regime . In the Nazi-occupied countries , guns were confiscated from everyone . If a family could not produce and immediately surrender a firearm that had once been registered to someone in the family , the entire family would be executed on the spot . In the Soviet Union , and then in the Eastern European countries that the Soviets took over following World War II , gun registration lists were likewise used for confiscation . Hitler and Stalin , like every dictator who perpetrated genocide during the 20th century , assiduously confiscated guns before starti ng thegenocide . The American people were well aware of this danger on the eve of World War II . In 1941 , when Congress passed the Property Requisition Act to allow the federal government to seize property that might be needed for the national defense , Congress specifically forbade the federal government from using this act to seize or registerguns ."

Remedying this could be the key to the organization regaining operating solvency . Since F Y 12 , revenues on the primary basket of parcel competitive product offerings at the USPS have grown at a 15 % CAGR to become over 20 % of total revenues ( up from 12.5 % just 5 years ago ) . By comparison , market-dominant products ex-services ( i . e . regular ISt Class Mail , etc . ) have declined at a 0.7 % CAGR , going from over 77 % of the USPS ' revenues to less than 69 % in F Y 16 . Given its challenged profitability , one would expect that the USPS grew yields on its competitive products to offset these market-dominant volume losses and the increased operating expenses . Yet while nominal pricing grew between 2 % and almost 8 % across competitive products on an annualized basis since FY13 , mix effects from faster groiMh in lower-yielding Parcel Select and First-Class Package Service offerings rendered overall yields slightly down ( \" 30 bps on an annualized basis ) , and to this day , price still does not cover all-in costs . Despite this irrationally priced competition , FedEx and UPS were able to grow ground yields by a weighted average 3.2 % annually , with FedEx yields growing faster than UPS's ."

The practices detailed in the USTR's investigation have caused concem around the world . China's illicit trade practices \" ignored for years by Washington \" have destroyed thousands of American factories and millions of American jobs . On April 3 , 2018 : the USTR announced approximately S50 billion in proposed tariffs on imports from China as an initial means to obtain the elimination of policies and practices identified in the investigation . Rather than remedy its misconduct : China has chosen to haml our fanners and manufacturers . In light of China's unfair retaliation : I have instructed the USTR to consider whether SIOO billion of additional tariffs would be appropriate under section 301 and , if so : to identify the products upon which to impose such tariffs . I have also instructed the Secretary of Agriculture : with the support of other members of my Cabinet : to use his broad authority to implement a plan to protect our fanners and agricultural interests . Notwithstanding these actions , the United States is still prepared to have discussions in further support of our commitment to achieving free : fair , and reciprocal trade and to protect the technology and intellectual property of American companies and American people . Trade barriers must be taken down to enhance economic growth in America and around the world . I am committed to enabling American companies and workers to compete on a level playing field around the world , and I will never allow unfair trade practices to undennine American interests ."

Ten years later , Sanders took a similarly cautious approach to same-sex marriage . In 2006 , he took a stand against same-sex marriage in Vermont , stating that he instead endorsed civil unions . Sanders told the Associated Press that he was \" comfortable \" with civil unions , not full marriage equality . ( To justify his stance , Sanders complained that a battle for same-sex marriage would be too \" divisive . \" ) At the time , he also opposed a federal anti-gay - marriage amendment \" but so did his Republican opponent for the Senate seat , Richard Tarrant , who also supported civil unions . With a wide lead in the polls and little at stake , Sanders declined to differentiate himself from his opponent by taking the lead on gay rights . Earlier in his political career , Sanders was even more indifferent toward gay rights , which W . J . Conroy recounts in his book Challenging the Boundaries of Reform : Socialism in Burlington . When serving as mayor of Burlington , Sanders told an interviewer that LGBT rights were not a \" major priority \" for him . Asked if he would support a bill to protect gays from job discrimination , Sanders responded , \" probably not . \" That was more than 25 years ago . Sanders has , no doubt , come a long way since then : The senator endorsed Vermont's successful Marriage Equality Act in 2009 and has cheered the Supreme Court's marriage rulings . And he is co-sponsoring the Equality Act , a sweeping federal LGBT rights bill that advocacy groups place high on their post-marriage agenda .

In this matter , the example of the inferior classes , the fertility of the feeble-minded , the mentally defective , the poverty - stricken classes , should not be held up for emulation to the mentally and physically fit though less fertile parents of the educated and well-to-do classes . On the contrary , the most urgent problem today is how to limit and discourage the over-fertility of the mentally and physically defective . Birth Control is not advanced as a panacea by which past and present evils of dysgenic breeding can be magically eliminated . Possibly drastic and Spartan methods may be forced upon society if it continues complacently to encourage the chance and chaotic breeding that has resulted from our stupidly cruel sentimentalism . But to prevent the repetition , to effect the salvation of the generations of the future \" nay of the generations of today \" our greatest need is first of all the ability to face the situation without flinching , and to cooperate in the formation of a code of sexual ethics based upon a thorough biological and psychological understanding of human nature ; and then to answer the questions and the needs of the people with all the intelligence and honesty at our command . If we can summon the bravery to do this , we shall best be serving the true interests of Eugenics , because our work will then have a practical and pragmatic value .
