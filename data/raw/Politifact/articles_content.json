      "Donald Trump continues to attack Hillary Clinton on everything from campaign spending to ISIS.",
      "At a rally in Phoenix, he accused her of taking money from countries that have a poor rapport with women and gay people.",
      "\"She's been given tens of millions of dollars by countries that treat women horribly,\" Trump said June 18. \"And countries that kill gays, they kill gays, they push them off of buildings.\"",
      "Trump, whose campaign did not return a request for comment, seems to be referencing donations given to the Clinton Foundation. Trump has referenced her foundation ties in the past, saying she needs to \"return the $25 million\" Saudi Arabia gave the foundation.",
      "The William J. Clinton Foundation was incorporated in 1997. The foundation agreed to disclose its donors when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009.",
      "We wondered whether the Clintons' donor list holds up to Trump's claim.",
      "But first, it is important to note that political candidates cannot take money from foreign entities.",
      "\"The prohibition in the Federal Election Campaign Act is against candidates or political committees soliciting, accepting or receiving contributions from foreign nationals, not only governments,\" said Michael Malbin, a political science professor at the University at Albany.",
      "Hillary Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin also noted that the former first lady played no role in the foundation while she was secretary of state.",
      "\"Further, she did not blink before standing up to countries that oppressed their people and denied them of their rights, from LGBT rights to women's rights,\" Schwerin said.",
      "Nonetheless. looking at the Clinton Foundation's donor list, Saudi Arabia gave between $10 million and $25 million. But the foundation reported the Saudi money in December 2008, and the amount hasn't changed since. Clinton Foundation spokesman Brian Cookstra pointed out that Saudi Arabia did not give to the foundation while Secretary Clinton was at the State Department.",
      "The foundation has also taken between $1 million and $5 million each from United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman. As The Wall Street Journal reported, several of these donations came in 2014, after Clinton's tenure at the State Department.",
      "We've fact-checked a similar claim before when Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said in April 2015 that Clinton took money from the kings of \"Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Oman and Yemen.\" Every country except Yemen has contributed to the Clinton Foundation, but Preibus' claim made it seem like Clinton herself took the money. We rated it Half True.",
      "Women's rights",
      "Human Rights Watch tracks how women are treated in each of these countries.",
      "In Saudi Arabia, a woman needs \"male guardian\" approval on everything from obtaining a passport to seeking higher education. They also have no divorce rights.",
      "The same male approval is needed for marriage in United Arab Emirates, plus laws there also allow a husband to assault his wife and children.",
      "In Qatar, marital rape is permitted. Women need a male guardian to approve a marriage contract, and one law specifies that a wife must obey her husband.",
      "And in Oman, Human Rights Watch notes that while there is a nondiscrimination law, women still face discrimination when it comes to domestic issues such as child custody and divorce.",
      "Gay rights",
      "According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, all sex outside of marriage, including same-sex intercourse, in Saudi Arabia is punishable by death.",
      "For a married man, the penalty is death by stoning. An unmarried man faces 100 blows of a whip.",
      "In Qatar, any sexual act outside of marriage is punishable by death.",
      "The United Arab Emirates also bans sex outside of marriage, and the death penalty could apply to consensual \"same-sex relations.\"",
      "As for Oman, the country punishes same-sex acts by up to three years in prison.",
      "As for Trump's claim that these countries are throwing gay people \"off of buildings,\" he may be referring to the Islamic State. There is evidence that ISIS has engaged in these acts, but in Syria.",
      "Executions in Saudi Arabia specifically have increased recently, but specific convictions, and whether are they related to homosexuality, are hard to measure.",
      "Not Clinton directly",
      "Experts we spoke with questioned whether the donations to the foundation are directly attributable to Hillary Clinton.",
      "Indiana University public affairs professor emeritus Leslie Lenkowsky said Trump's claim is hyperbolic.",
      "\"These were not donations to Secretary Clinton as such, but to an organization with which she was closely involved (when not in office or seeking it), including serving as a director,\" Lenkowsky said.",
      "According to Brian Mittendorf, an accounting professor at Ohio State University, nonprofits often have to consider donors' actions when they give money. The stakes are usually higher when the nonprofit involves a political figure.",
      "\"These are gifts not to Clinton herself but to the foundation that shares her name,\" he said.",
      "The United States remains allies with some of these countries, such as Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar, despite their poor record with human rights.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said that Hillary Clinton has \"been given tens of millions of dollars by countries that treat women horribly...and countries that kill gays.\"",
      "Trump's comment oversimplifies donations to the Clinton Foundation to make a quick attack against his Democratic rival. He makes it sound as if Clinton personally received money from foreign governments with poor records on human rights. But political candidates cannot accept donations from foreign governments.",
      "However, several countries with harsh rules for women and that kill gays have contributed to the Clinton Foundation both before and after her tenure at the State Department.",
      "We rate Trump's claim Half True."

      "EDITOR'S NOTE: On July 28, 2016, PolitiFact California rated as True a statement by Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom that Republican Indiana Governor and now Vice President-Elect Mike Pence \"advocated diverting taxpayer dollars to so-called conversion therapy.\" We based that ruling on a statement Pence made in 2000 on his congressional campaign website, in which Pence says \"Resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.\" Subsequently, our readers and other fact-checking websites examined the claim and made some points that led us to reconsider the fact check. Readers pointed out that Pence never explicitly advocated for conversion therapy in his statement and that he may have been pushing for safer sex practices. Pence's words are open to other interpretations: Gay and lesbian leaders, for example, say his statement continues to give the impression that he supported the controversial practice of conversion therapy when his words are viewed in context with his long opposition to LGBT rights. Taking all of this into account, we are changing our rating to Half True and providing this new analysis.",
      "PolitiFact California's practice is to consider new evidence and perspectives related to our fact checks, and to revise our ratings when warranted.",
      "California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom joined in the chorus of attacks on Donald Trump's choice for running mate during a speech at the Democratic National Convention in late July.",
      "Newsom, a prominent LGBT rights supporter, said Republican Indiana Gov. and now Vice-President Elect Mike Pence \"advocated for diverting taxpayer dollars to so-called conversion therapy.\"",
      "Conversion therapy is a controversial practice that seeks to change a person's sexual orientation from gay to straight. It's banned in five states including California, Oregon, Illinois, Vermont and New Jersey.",
      "Our research",
      "When asked about the claim in late July, Newsom's campaign spokesman pointed to Pence's own words. During his first successful run for Congress in 2000, Pence wrote on his campaign website, under a section called Strengthening the American Family:",
      "\"Congress should support the reauthorization of the Ryan White Care Act only after completion of an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus. Resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.\"",
      "Many, including Newsom and other LGBT advocates, have interpreted the last portion of Pence's statement, about \"assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior,\" as evidence he supported conversion therapy.",
      "The statement, however, does not explicitly mention conversion therapy. And Pence has said little, if anything, specific on the topic. We heard from a number of readers who said Pence's words could be interpreted as supporting groups that aim to not necessarily change one's sexual orientation, but instead as supporting groups that advocate for curbing sexual behaviors that lead to the spread of HIV/AIDS. Pence has, for example, advocated for abstinence as a way to prevent sexual diseases.",
      "\"Indeed, promoting safer sexual behaviour is a common intervention strategy in the fight against HIV/AIDS,\" reader Justin Goddard of Ontario, Canada, said in an email.",
      "Other fact-checking websites, such as Snopes.com, have examined the claim Pence supported conversion therapy and concluded it's not a settled case.",
      "LGBT rights advocates say given Pence's extensive record of opposing gays and lesbians, his words are indeed confirmation that he supported conversion therapy.",
      "\"That is very specific language some might call it a dog whistle that has been used for decades to very thinly cloak deeply homophobic beliefs,\" Rea Carey, executive director of the National L.G.B.T.Q. Task Force told the New York Times in late November. \"Particularly the phrase seeking to change their sexual behavior,' to me, is code for conversion therapy.\"",
      "\"It's the most likely reading\" of Pence's words, Rick Zbur, executive director of Equality California, an LGBT civil rights group, told PolitiFact California. \"We view this in the context of the whole record. You can't think of someone who is more hostile to LGBT people and people with AIDS than Mike Pence.\"",
      "Also on the 2000 website, Pence wrote: \"Congress should oppose any effort to put gay and lesbian relationships on an equal legal status with heterosexual marriage.\" And \"Congress should oppose any effort to recognize homosexual's [sic] as a 'discreet [sic] and insular minority' entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities.\"",
      "Statement mischaracterized?",
      "In an email exchange with PolitiFact California in late July, Pence's spokesman Marc Lotter did not directly answer whether Pence supported conversion therapy.",
      "Four months later, Lotter told the New York Times, however, that it was \"patently false\" that Mr. Pence \"supported or advocated\" the practice of conversion therapy.",
      "Lotter added that Pence had been calling for federal funds to \"be directed to groups that promoted safe sexual practices\" during his 2000 congressional campaign, and he said it was a \"mischaracterization\" to interpret the statement as a reference to conversion therapy.",
      "Newsom's campaign spokesman said in November he did not have any additional information pointing to Pence's stance on conversion therapy.",
      "As reported by McClatchy DC in July, Pence continues to be at the center of gay rights controversy: \"Pence angered gay rights groups (in 2015) when he signed a religious freedom bill that opponents said would allow businesses to discriminate against customers based on their sexual orientation. Pence later backtracked, when state lawmakers changed the law to say that no discrimination would be allowed.\"",
      "At the Republican National Convention this summer, the McClatchy news service noted: \"Delegates voted to approve a platform that backs the right of parents to determine the proper medical treatment and therapy for their minor children. The platform makes no specific mention of gay conversion therapy, but critics say that passage is aimed at accepting the notion that one's sexual orientation can be changed.\"",
      "GOP Party Chairman Reince Priebus, who President-Elect Donald Trump has selected as chief of staff for the incoming administration, has denied that passage encourages conversion therapy.",
      "Our ruling",
      "California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom said Indiana Governor and now Vice President-Elect Mike Pence \"advocated for diverting taxpayer dollars to so-called conversion therapy.\"",
      "Pence's own words on his campaign website from 2000, specifically a passage that calls for funding groups that give \"assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior,\" have been interpreted by LGBT advocates as supporting the controversial practice.",
      "Pence's statement, however, does not explicitly mention conversion therapy. Readers and other fact-checking outlets have said Pence may have been calling for safer sexual sexual practices rather than pushing for efforts to change one's sexual orientation.",
      "When asked about the statement in July, Pence's spokesman Marc Lotter did not directly answer whether the Indiana governor supports the practice. Months later, Lotter strongly denied that Pence supports conversion therapy and said Pence was calling for funds to \"be directed to groups that promoted safe sexual practices\"",
      "Given Pence's strong and extensive opposition to LGBT rights, his words in 2000 have been widely interpreted as supporting the controversial practice. Rea Carey, executive director of the National L.G.B.T.Q. Task Force, has called them \"a dog whistle\" for like-minded supporters of conversion therapy.",
      "Newsom's definitive claim, however, that Pence advocated for conversion therapy is not fully supported.",

      "Stoking their long-running feud, California Gov. Jerry Brown recently jabbed at former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, saying Golden State is \"growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas.\"",
      "Brown made this claim in the middle of an impassioned defense of climate change science at the American Geophysical Union conference on Dec. 14, 2016 in San Francisco.",
      "\"We've proved in California that the economy grows. And it grows in part because of the climate rules that we've adopted,\" Brown said.",

      "In his speech, Brown said Perry's critiques about California's job-killing red tape don't hold up.",
      "\"Now remember our new secretary of energy, he was coming to California to say: Come to Texas because we have all the jobs in Texas.\"",
      "\"Well, Rick: I got some news for you, California is growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas, and we have more sun than you have oil!\"",

      "Gov. Jerry Brown makes his claim about California \"growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas\" at about the 13:00 minute mark in the video above.",
      "With Brown's reference of Perry, we took his \"faster than Texas\" claim to mean faster economic growth with a focus on jobs. We decided to zero-in on job growth rates in California and Texas, while also weighing GDP and unemployment trends in the states.",
      "We'll leave the fun comparison of sunshine to oil for Brown and Perry to wrestle with another day.",
      "Our research",
      "We concede there's no definition for what \"a hell of a lot faster\" growth looks like. Still, we'll do our best to sort out the governor's claim.",
      "Brown's spokeswoman pointed us to several news articles detailing California's recent economic improvements.",
      "Looking solely at 2015 job growth rates, Brown's claim appears to hold up.",
      "In that year, California added 483,000 jobs, posting a jobs growth rate of 3 percent, based on data we crunched from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That pace was twice as fast as Texas' 1.5 percent job growth rate.",
      "California's rapid employment gains have slowed somewhat to about 2 percent this year through November. That may not qualify as \"a hell of a lot faster,\" but it's still greater than Texas' roughly 1.6 percent job growth rate so far this year.",
      "The business website Kiplinger.com forecast California would rank 10th in the nation among states for fastest job growth in 2016. It noted that Texas was not on its Top 10 list.",
      "It wasn't long ago, however, that Texas outpaced California.",
      "In 2014, Texas recorded a 3.7 percent job growth rate, ahead of California's 2.9 percent pace.",
      "Looking to the future, California's job gains may slow. The closely watched UCLA Anderson Forecast predicts jobs to grow by only 1.5 percent in the state during 2017 and just 0.8 percent in 2018.",
      "Because Brown used the phrase \"is growing,\" we'll judge him on the most recent figures, not future forecasts.",
      "Overall economy",
      "While the pace of job growth is important, it's not the only measurement of a state's economic health. And Brown's claim could be interpreted as California's overall economy, not just jobs, is growing much faster than the economy in Texas.",
      "In August, PolitiFact Texas took a deep look at the economies of both California and Texas to evaluate a June claim by Juli n Castro, the U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development, that \"Today, California is kicking our butt, creating more jobs and more economic growth than Texas.\"",
      "It rated the claim True, citing greater jobs, per capita income and GDP growth rates in California. It noted Texas had a lower jobless rate.",
      "Building on that fact check, we looked at the most recent economic figures for both states to see if the assessment still holds.",
      "We found that California's GDP grew faster than Texas' in the first two quarters of this year, at rates of 2 percent and most recently 2.2 percent compared with Texas' 1.3 percent and its most recent quarter, a negative 0.8 percent, according to a news release in December by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.",
      "It was a different story in 2015 when Texas' GDP expanded by 4.8 percent (a figure that was recently revised upward) compared with California's 3.8 percent GDP expansion.",
      "Comparing unemployment rates, Texas, at 4.6 percent in November, has consistently fared better than California, where the rate was 5.3 percent in November, and has hovered well above 5 percent this year.",
      "California had one more economic bright spot in 2015: Per capita personal income grew at twice the rate as in Texas, 5.4 percent to 2.6 percent, according to federal data.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Gov. Jerry Brown recently claimed \"California is growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas.\"",
      "We took this to mean economic growth with a focus on the pace of job creation. California's 3 percent job growth rate in 2015, which doubled Texas' pace, definitely fits into Brown's colorful claim.",
      "But California's rate has slowed to about 2 percent so far this year, closer to Texas' 1.6 job growth rate.",
      "Other economic metrics show California faring better than Texas in several, though not all, categories: California's GDP expanded faster than Texas' GDP in the first two quarters of this year, though Texas had a faster GDP growth rate in 2015. Also, per capita income grew twice as fast in California as Texas in 2015, also backing Brown's statement.",
      "Texas, however, has consistently held a lower jobless rate than California in recent years.",
      "Brown, like the state's economy in recent years, is on the right track. And while California has expanded jobs and its economy faster than Texas in many cases, there are a few cases where that growth has been strong but not necessarily \"a hell of a lot faster.\"",

      "Recently, a gun rights group, the Firearms Policy Coalition, in a June 16 email blast claimed Proposition 63 would restrict not only ammo sales, but \"criminalize the sharing of bullets between hunting and shooting partners.\"",
      "The Sacramento-based coalition describes itself as a grassroots nonprofit dedicated to defending Second Amendment rights.",
      "We decided to examine the claim: Would Proposition 63 really criminalizes the sharing of bullets between friends?",
      "Our research",
      "We started by checking the text of the Proposition.",
      "It broadly restricts ammunition sales by requiring instant background checks and requiring, by January 2018, all sales \"be conducted or processed through a licensed ammunition vendor,\" according to Section 8 of the text. Law enforcement would be exempted.",
      "Currently, the state does not require a license or record keeping for ammunition sales, according to the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.",
      "By contrast, the restrictions Proposition 63 places on sharing or \"transferring\" ammunition are not as strict. Still, they would change some aspects of the largely unregulated practice.",
      "The measure would:",
      "-- Make it illegal for an individual to share bullets with \"any person who he or she knows or using reasonable care should know\" is banned from owning or possessing ammunition;",
      "-- Make it illegal for someone to share bullets if they know they will be subsequently sold or transferred to a person banned from owning them;",
      "-- Require individuals meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition;",
      "The new crimes would be classified as a misdemeanors, punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine, according to the measure. They are listed under proposed changes to Sections 30306 and 30312 of the California Penal Code.",
      "\"They could still freely transfer and share that ammunition with their hunting and shooting partners provided that they do so in person and do not have knowledge that the ammunition would subsequently be provided to a felon or other prohibited person,\" Dan Newman, spokesman for the Safety For All Initiative, wrote in an email.",

      "An AK-47 rifle 30-round magazine is seen with 30 rounds of 7.62x39mm ammunition, in Alexandria, Va., Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)",
      "Our ruling",
      "The Firearms Policy Coalition recently claimed California's Proposition 63 would \"Criminalize the sharing of ammunition between friends who may be hunting or shooting together.\"",
      "The initiative would create some new restrictions on bullet sharing.",

      "Breaking the new rules would be considered a misdemeanor.",
      "The coalition's statement, however, gives the wrong and overly broad impression that friends on a hunting trip or at a shooting range could never legally share a bullet -- that somehow the measure would \"criminalize\" all aspects of sharing a box of bullets with your shooting partner.",

      "On Monday, Trump spokesman Jason Miller cited a national study done by the Pew Research Center showing that approximately 24 million voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or inaccurate. However, no one from Trump's office has shown evidence of \"serious voter fraud\" in California.",
      "Trump may be drawing on an unsupported claim that 3 million \"illegal aliens\" cast votes in this year's election. That allegation was made on Twitter by Gregg Phillips, who has worked for the Republican Party and has a voter fraud reporting app.",
      "PolitiFact reported that Phillips has not released any corroborating evidence and noted that public information undermines his statement. It rated his claim False.",
      "On Nov. 8 in California, there were reports of election glitches, such as the wrong names being placed on some absentee ballots and long lines at some polling places.",
      "But state and local election officials, along with independent observers, say there have been no reports of widespread voter fraud in the state.",
      "\"His allegations are completely unfounded,\" California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said in an interview. \"I think it's a big disservice to our country and to our democracy to continue to raise these doubts. If anything, a message back to Mr. Trump is, if you have proof, if you have evidence, please bring it forward. Procedures are in place to investigate any real voter fraud. But as the evidence has shown, the cases of voter fraud across the country are statistically minimal if you go back decades.\"",
      "Padilla's office could not immediately say how many voter fraud complaints it's received for this and past general elections.",

      "Logan added in an email to PolitiFact California that: \"Quantifying complaints or allegations of voter fraud is not a specific data set that we track. That alone probably gives you a sense of the frequency, but there is no indication that the rate of concern on this issue was higher in this election cycle than in any other.\"",
      "He added that there are legal avenues for challenging a voter's eligibility. But none were used before or after the election, he said.",
      "\"And I think that sort of goes to the point that there's nothing to back up those allegations,\" Logan said.",
      "Sacramento County's Assistant Registrar of Voters Alice Jarboe said of the more than 530,000 county voters that turned out on Election Day, none has made a complaint about voter fraud.",
      "Jarboe, who's worked at the department for 18 years, said no complaints are \"the norm\" for elections in her county.",

      "\"No system is perfect -- people do make mistakes,\" Alexander said.",
      "She added, however, that California's voter verification laws are among the most robust in the country. Each county, she noted, is automatically required to perform a recount a fraction of its ballots by hand.",
      "The state also prohibits paperless electronic voting, a type of voting that makes audits nearly impossible, she said.",
      "Trump's unsupported claim about voter fraud in California may also draw on misinformation about two recent state laws: AB 60, which allows undocumented immigrants to obtain state driver's licenses; and the New Motor Voter Act, which by mid-2017 will automatically register citizens to vote when they obtain or renew a driver's license.",
      "The automatic registration only applies to citizens who are already eligible to vote, not to undocumented immigrants. Padilla, California's secretary of state, has said the new system would require potential voters to show identification such as a birth certificate or passport to reflect their citizenship before they are registered.",
      "California voters, in most cases, are not required to show identification at their polling places.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Donald Trump claimed \"serious voter fraud\" took place on Election Day in California. He offered no evidence backing up his statement and his press team did not respond specifically to a request about fraud in the state.",
      "Elections officials and nonpartisan observers in California said there were no widespread reports of voter fraud. The state has some of the most stringent voter verification laws in the country. Allegations of fraud are so rare that Los Angeles County, the state's largest county, does not track them.",
      "PolitiFact New Hampshire examined Trump's claim that the Granite State also experienced \"serious voter fraud.\" It described Trump's statement as \"reckless claim with zero evidence,\" and rated it Pants On Fire after finding there were \"no complaints of voter fraud filed in an election in which more than 728,000 ballots were cast.\"",

      "We decided to fact-check whether any judges found the claims against Jones have \"no merit.\"",
      "Claim part of larger lawsuit",
      "The accusations about sexual advances are from Tosca Olives, who, beginning as a young sheriff's deputy, said she had about 30 inappropriate encounters with Jones between 2003 and 2005. Her claims were inserted into a larger lawsuit brought against the Sheriff's Department by four deputies alleging workplace retaliation, sexual harassment and sexual discrimination by their supervisors.",
      "Only the retaliation claim advanced to trial. A jury sided with the deputies on that charge and awarded them nearly $3.6 million.",
      "Before the trial started, deputies used Olives' subpoenaed testimony to support their claims of a hostile work environment based on sexual favoritism.",
      "Sacramento Superior Court Judge David I. Brown, however, did not allow the sexual harassment and favoritism claims, including Olives' supporting testimony, to advance. He did not because the deputies \"failed to initially plead the cause of action or raise it with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing,\" according to a Sacramento Bee fact check.",

      "Once the trial started, Macdonald said a second superior court judge, David DeAlba, ruled Olives could not testify. He described this decision \"as close as Sheriff Jones can get to an exoneration in this format.\"",
      "Macdonald added: \"In sum, no Judge did - or would ever - say I find no merit to these allegations,' but each of the Judge's rulings in that regard is as close as it would get, and can reasonably be taken with that meaning.\"",

      "\"The $52 billion tax will also put Californians in a special, yet unenviable category drivers who pay the highest gas tax in the nation,\" Patterson said in the release issued April 10, 2017.",
      "With Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown's signature the bill will go into effect in November.",
      "The Golden State's per gallon gas tax is already high. We set out to fact-check whether it really will be the highest in the country.",
      "Our research",
      "Asked for evidence, Patterson's spokeswoman pointed us to a map showing state-by-state gasoline tax rates produced in March 2016 by the nonprofit Tax Foundation.",
      "That map and its numbers, however, are outdated.",
      "A map produced in January 2017 by the foundation includes the most current state-by-state gas tax rates. Those rates are calculated by adding up state and local gas taxes and fees.",
      "",
      "It shows Pennsylvania has the highest per gallon tax rate in the nation at more than 58 cents. California's current per gallon tax is about 38 cents per gallon, the seventh highest in the nation.",
      "Do the arithmetic: Even with the 12-cent increase, California's tax will trail Pennsylvania's by 8 cents per gallon.",
      "\"You won't be No. 1, that's for sure,\" said John Buhl, a spokesman for the Washington D.C.-based Tax Foundation. \"Pennsylvania will still be the highest.\"",
      "A chart produced in January 2017 by the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association, confirms the tax foundation's figures, though it adds in the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax for each state.",
      "Based on current rates, California's increase will likely result in the second highest state gas tax in the nation, ahead of Washington and Hawaii.",
      "This second highest tax ranking could leave California with the highest overall gas prices at the pump, according to energy analysts.",
      "We looked at that topic in a recent article. As of this week, California's average price was $2.99 per gallon. It trailed only Hawaii's $3.04, for a margin of about 5 cents per gallon. The 12 cent per gallon increase could cause California to leap-frog Hawaii, analysts said.",
      "Joe Henchman, a vice president with the Tax Foundation, noted that California also adds a 2.25 percent sales tax on gasoline.",
      "This sales tax is not counted by the foundation or the petroleum institute as part of the state's gas tax. But based on the current price of gasoline in the state, it represents about 6 or 7 cents per gallon in tax, which \"would not entirely close the gap with Pennsylvania,\" Henchman said.",
      "Five other states charge a sales tax on gasoline: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Indiana and Illinois. Pennsylvania does not.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Republican State Assemblyman Jim Patterson claimed California's recent gas tax increase, once approved by Gov. Jerry Brown as expected, would result in the \"highest gas tax in the nation.\"",
      "Patterson relied on outdated gas tax rates.",
      "Current figures from the Tax Foundation show California's per gallon gas tax will still trail Pennsylvania's rate by more than 6 cents, even after the tax hike goes into effect in November.",
      "California would likely move from seventh highest to second in the nation.",
      "These figures are also confirmed by the American Petroleum Institute.",
      "In the end, we rate Patterson's claim False.",
      "UPDATE: This fact-check has been updated with comments from Joe Henchman of the Tax Foundation about the sales tax California charges on gasoline.",
      "The foundation provided us a second update later in April 2017 that accounted for an additional and less-publicized gas tax increase under California's new legislation. It concluded \"Pennsylvania will still be highest, but by a narrower margin.\" This latest update factors in an additional 7.5 cent per gallon gas tax increase that would start in July 2019. This is on top of the 12 cent per gallon hike that would go into effect in November.",
      "The state's full gas tax increase would amount to 19.5 cents per gallon by this time. California's overall gas tax would climb to 58.3 cents per gallon under the foundation's latest calculations. We continue to rate Patterson's claim as False as the foundation concluded this higher California gas tax, even in 2019, would be \"just behind Pennsylvania's highest-in-the-nation 59.3 (cents-per-gallon) tax.\"",

      "The debate over President Trump's proposed border wall intensified this week, with opponents saying the barrier would be ineffective and a costly mistake.",
      "Building \"a big, beautiful wall\" on the Southern border was Trump's signature promise during his campaign, winning him support from advocates for hard-line immigration reform.",
      "But when Trump initially demanded funding for the wall be included in a stop-gap budget measure needed to avoid a government shutdown, opponents in Congress balked.",
      "Rep. Scott Peters, D-San Diego, said the billions needed to build the wall should be used elsewhere.",
      "Peters went on to make an eye-opening claim about what money for the wall could fund instead:",
      "\"We've checked in with The Navy; if we don't pass the 2017 budget, they're talking here about five ships that won't be available to sail just out of the Western region and 15 worldwide...the money for the wall? That's, by the way, (the cost of) one and a half aircraft carriers,\" Peters was quoted as saying on April 24, 2017 in a Politico news article.",
      "We know cost estimates for the wall are high. But would the price really equate to \"one and a half aircraft carriers\"?",
      "We set sail on a fact check.",
      "Paying for a \"big, beautiful wall\"",
      "The U.S. border with Mexico is nearly 2,000 miles long. It already includes about 650 miles of fencing constructed under previous administrations. Trump has said the wall doesn't need to span the entire border, adding in a television interview that \"We don't need 2,000 (miles), we need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.\"",
      "During his campaign, Trump initially said he could build a wall for $4 billion and later estimated $6 billion to $7 billion. In April 2017, he put it at $10 billion or less.",
      "The Associated Press reported in March that the Trump Administration wants to build a 30-foot-high border wall that \"looks good from the north side and is difficult to climb or cut through,\" according to a pair of contract notices posted to a government website.",
      "",
      "A drone's view of the US-Mexico border fence as seen from Nogales, Mexico, Sunday, April 2, 2017. (Brian Skoloff / AP)",
      "Cost estimates for the wall vary greatly. Here are some relevant estimates, as chronicled by news publication Quartz.",
      "In July 2016, Bernstein Research, a firm that analyzes material costs, put the price tag at $15 billion to $25 billion, for a wall that stretches 1,000 miles and is 40 feet high, which was Trump's initial desired height.",
      "In January 2017, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the wall would be $12 billion to $15 billion.",
      "In February 2017, a leaked report from the Department of Homeland Security put it much higher, at $21.6 billion.",
      "In April 2017, the Democratic staff of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee said in a report that costs could soar to nearly $70 billion not including the significant costs and legal resources required for land acquisition.",
      "Peters' spokesman Jacob Peters said the congressman used the $21.6 billion estimate because it \"comes from the internal report done by the Department of Homeland Security.\"",
      "\"This estimate falls somewhere in the middle of the range of cost estimates,\" the spokesman added. \"Because this report was commissioned by (Department of Homeland Security) Secretary Kelly, and is based on the Trump administration's own planning process to build walls and fences to cover almost the entirety of the border that is not already fenced, it is the best current estimate for what President Trump is likely to ask Congress to appropriate to build his border wall.\"",
      "We also used the $21.6 billion as our estimate.",
      "Aircraft carrier cost",
      "Finding the cost of the latest U.S. aircraft carrier is a bit easier. Peters' spokesman pointed to a Congressional Research Service report from April 2017 that places the cost of each new \"Navy Ford Class Aircraft Carrier\" at approximately $12.9 billion.",
      "That's up from the $8.5 billion cost of carriers in the Navy's most-recent Nimitz class, according to a Navy fact sheet.",
      "The first carrier in the new class, the USS Gerald R. Ford, is expected to be commissioned later in 2017. It's been described as \"the most expensive and most advanced warship ever built.\"",
      "Still, when we do the math, it appears Peters slightly underestimated his comparison: Building a $21.6 billion border wall would cost about 1.67 times the price of these new warships.",
      "We asked Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego to examine the cost figures.",
      "Reaser told us the number \"does appear to check out.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Democratic Congressman Scott Peters recently claimed the estimated price of President Trump's border wall is the same as the cost of \"one and a half aircraft carriers.\"",
      "Peters used a $21.6 billion estimate, citing a leaked report from the Trump Administration's Department of Homeland Security. That figure is within the $15 billion to $25 billion range produced by a private research firm.",
      "Peters referenced the $12.9 billion price tag on the Navy's newest class of aircraft carriers from a Congressional Research Service report.",
      "At this early stage, no one knows how much Trump's wall will really cost. Partisan sources have it all over the map. And delays and cost-overruns are common for large government projects: Just take a look at California's massive high-speed rail initiative.",
      "But Peters selected what appears to be the best initial estimate from Trump's own homeland security analysts.",

      "But we wondered whether this was really a settled matter.",
      "We set out on a fact check.",
      "Our research",
      "We started by checking out the 2015 National Academy of Sciences study Villaraigosa cited. It found: \"Immigrants are in fact much less likely to commit crime than natives, and the presence of large numbers of immigrants seems to lower crime rates.\" The study added that \"This disparity also holds for young men most likely to be undocumented immigrants: Mexican, Salvadoran, and Guatemalan men.\"",
      "It continued: \"Today, the belief that immigrants are more likely to commit crimes is perpetuated by issue entrepreneurs' who promote the immigrant-crime connection in order to drive restrictionist immigration policy.\"",
      "The academy is a nonprofit research organization charged with providing independent advice to the nation. It is funded largely by the federal government.",
      "Findings in a March 2017 study by the libertarian Cato Institute also support Villaraigosa's statement:",
      "\"Illegal immigrants are 44 percent less likely to be incarcerated than natives. Legal immigrants are 69 percent less likely to be incarcerated than natives. Legal and illegal immigrants are underrepresented in the incarcerated population while natives are overrepresented.\"",
      "The Cato study used information from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey for immigrants aged 18 to 54 who are incarcerated in the United States.",
      "To examine Villaraigosa's claim, we also relied on research into similar claims by our partner national PolitiFact. In July 2016, it rated Mostly True a statement by Libertarian candidate for president Gary Johnson that Mexican immigrants \"are more law-abiding than U.S. citizens and that is a statistic.\"",
      "PolitiFact found several studies that back up this claim by citing incarceration rates. It also found groups that challenged those studies or said more research is needed.",
      "PolitiFact's findings",
      "PolitiFact pointed to a July 2015 report by the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit in Washington. The council analyzed data from the Census' 2010 American Community Survey and found that about 1.6 percent of all immigrant males (Census does not specify legal status) between 18 and 39 years old were incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born population.",
      "Looking at California prisons, immigrants are also underrepresented. U.S.-born men are incarcerated in the state at a rate of more than two-and-a-half times greater than that of foreign-born men, according to a study by the Public Policy Institute of California.",
      "The American Immigration Council also reported that 2010 Census data shows incarceration rates of young, less educated Mexican, Salvadoran and Guatemalan men which comprise the bulk of the unauthorized population are \"significantly lower\" than incarceration rates of native-born young men without a high-school diploma.",
      "Specifically for Mexican men ages 18 to 39, the incarceration rate in 2010 was 2.8 percent, compared to 10.7 percent for native-born men in the same age group, the council's report said.",
      "Immigrants come to the United States to build better lives for themselves and their children, said Walter A. Ewing, a senior researcher at the American Immigration Council and one of the report's authors.",
      "\"They are very motivated to not blow that opportunity by getting in trouble with the police,\" he told PolitiFact. \"This is especially so for unauthorized immigrants, who can be deported at any time for unlawful presence.\"",
      "Crime trends",
      "PolitiFact also noted that as the immigrant population has increased, crime has gone down, citing Ewing's report.",
      "Between 1990 and 2013, the foreign-born share of the U.S. population increased from 7.9 percent to 13.1 percent, and the number of unauthorized immigrants went up from 3.5 million to 11.2 million. At the same time, the violent crime rate (murder, rape and aggravated assault) decreased 48 percent and property crime rate fell 41 percent, the report said, citing FBI data.",
      "Bianca E. Bersani, an assistant professor and director of the Criminology and Criminal Justice Program at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, says her research also shows that crime involvement among foreign-born residents is lower than that of U.S.-born citizens.",
      "\"The rhetoric of the criminal immigrant' does not align with the bulk of empirical research,\" Bersani said.",
      "According to Bersani's research, while first-generation immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population, the second generation (individuals born in the United States to at least one foreign-born parent) more closely resemble patterns of their native-born peers (three or more U.S.-born generations).",
      "\"This does not suggest that the second generation is uniquely crime prone, but instead that they are acting in ways that are no different from the rest of the U.S.-born population,\" Bersani said.",
      "Datasets with information on both crime and immigrant status are rare, Bersani said, though more research and data are becoming available.",
      "More research needed?",
      "The Center for Immigration Studies, which supports stricter immigration policies, in a 2009 study said that overall understanding of immigrants and crime \"remains confused\" due to lack of data and contrary information.",
      "Unless inmates are identified as immigrant or native-born, incarceration rates are a poor way to measure links between immigrants and crime, the study said.",
      "As PolitiFact reported in 2015, there isn't exact data on how many undocumented immigrants are currently incarcerated.",
      "PolitiFact California spoke about this critique with Ewing of the American Immigration Council, whose research supports Villaraigosa's claim. He said he's confident in the work that's been done and said critics have used anecdotes, rather than full-blown research, to try to make their points.",
      "Ewing added that the studies backing up Villaraigosa's statement are \"from such a wide range of researchers using so many different methodologies and sources of data -- not everyone can be wrong.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Villaraigosa said \"undocumented immigrants commit less crimes than the native born.\"",
      "He cited a 2015 study by the National Academy of Sciences that backs up this claim.",
      "In a fact check last year, PolitiFact rated a similar claim Mostly True. It cited additional studies by scholars and partisan groups that show that the foreign-born population is less likely to commit crimes than the native-born.",

      "SOURCE: California Legislative Analyst's Office.",
      "The property crime rate peaked in California at nearly 7,000 crimes per 100,000 population in the early 1980s. Three decades later, it had dropped by more than half.",
      "The violent crime rate saw a similar dramatic drop during this period.",

      "We took that to mean Brown's current stretch as governor, which started with his election to a third term in 2010 and continued with re-election to a fourth term in 2014.",
      "Brown served his first two terms as governor from 1975 to 1983.",
      "For this current stretch, we looked at crime data from 2010 through 2016, the most current year available.

      "No matter the exact years selected, California's crime story during over the past half decade is not as simple as Moorlach's statement implies.",
      "The statewide crime rate, which measures both violent and property crimes, ticked up in 2012 and 2015. It decreased, however, in the other four years during Brown's current stint.",
      "This overall crime rate includes violent and property crimes. Violent crimes are homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults. Examples of property crimes include burglary, theft and vandalism.",
      "Jonathan Peterson, a fiscal and policy analyst at the California Legislative Analyst's Office, cautioned that year-over-year changes can make it look like crime is growing rapidly, \"but it could be a blip.\"",
      "Peterson said the past six to seven years have been marked by fluctuations in California's crime rate, not a steady increase or decrease.",
      "Stanford Law School Professor John Donohue, who researches crime trends, said Moorlach's claim might contain an element of truth but overall is flawed.",
      "\"One has to be very cautious about politicians making statements about crime because they will often try to make the numbers say something that isn't quite representative,\" said Donohue. \"The broad trend for the last 25 years has been down and very benign. Crime is at a much lower level in practically every place today than it was 25 years ago. But in the last couple years there has been an uptick (in California and nationwide), and that's a reason for concern.\"",
      "Deeper look at crime data",
      "To fact-check Moorlach's claim about crime getting worse, we examined statistics from the California Department of Justice's recent report Crime in California 2016. It includes crime rate data from 1966 through 2016.",
      "The data show that from 2010 through 2015, the most recent year from which Moorlach likely drew his conclusions, California's overall crime rate declined slightly from 3,069 crimes per 100,000 population to 3,047 crimes per 100,000.",
      "This casts doubt on Moorlach's claim that crime has been getting worse.",
      "Even when examining the violent crime rate alone, the results are mixed. In three of the years since Brown was elected, the violent crime rate notched up, while it dipped in the the other three years.",
      "Had Moorlach narrowed his claim to 2011, Brown's first year back as governor, through 2015, the crime story would be slightly different. California's overall crime rate inched up between those years, from 3,007 crimes per 100,000 population to 3,047 per 100,000.",
      "Moorlach's response",
      "Sen. Moorlach's spokesman provided us with links to about a half-dozen news articles that detailed crime increases across California. None of the articles, however, showed a sustained increase from 2010 through 2016.",
      "In his op-ed, Moorlach cited a spike in violent crime in 2015. He's right for that single year for that type of crime: state justice department figures show an 8.4 percent rise in violent crime in 2015 compared with the prior year.",
      "In recent months, politicians such as Assemblyman Allen have pointed to this period as evidence for growing crime concern in California.",
      "Many have cited a PPIC analysis comparing the first half of 2014 to the same period in 2015. It found widespread increases in crime rates in California cities with a population greater than 100,000. Of the 66 California cities that size, 49 saw an increase in violent crime and 48 experienced increases in property crime. Many saw double digit percent increases.",
      "A subsequent report comparing the first half of 2016 with the first half of 2015 showed overall crime decreasing, driven by a drop in property crimes. That report was published by the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice, a policy research group that makes recommendations on alternatives to incarceration.",
      "Two weeks after Moorlach's op-ed was published, the California Department of Justice released statewide crime statistics for 2016.",
      "That report showed a slight decrease in the total crime rate, driven by a nearly 3 percent decline in the property crime rate. Violent crime, meanwhile, increased about 4 percent in 2016. We won't use these statistics as a determining factor in our rating for Moorlach's claim since his spokesman said the senator didn't have the report.",
      "The 2016 data, however, appear to support the idea that crime has not followed a consistent pattern in California over the past half dozen years.",
      "Our rating",
      "Republican State Sen. John Moorlach recently claimed \"crime has been getting worse since Jerry Brown was elected governor.\"",
      "His spokesman pointed to news articles that cite an uptick in crime in 2015, when many large cities in California saw double-digit increases in violent crime. But neither those articles nor state crime reports show a sustained increase from the time of Brown was elected governor in 2010 through the current period.",
      "In fact, there was a slight decrease in the state's overall crime rate from 2010 through 2015, the most recent year Moorlach was likely referring to.",
      "Crime researchers emphasized that California and the nation have experienced a dramatic decrease in crime in recent decades. They say California's crime rate increases in 2012 and in 2015, however, are reason for concern but are not evidence that crime has gotten worse over the past half dozen years.",
      "We rate Moorlach's claim Mostly False.",
      "MOSTLY FALSE The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",
      "After the Fact:",
      "Moorlach responds to crime fact check",
      "After our fact-check published, Sen. Moorlach responded by saying crime has increased in California under Gov. Jerry Brown if one looks at a more narrow period, from 2011 through 2015.",
      "We used 2010 as a baseline for our research given that Moorlach's original statement said \"crime has been getting worse since Jerry Brown was elected governor.\"",
      "Voters elected Brown governor in November 2010 and he took office in January 2011.",
      "Using 2010 as a baseline both adhered to Moorlach's original timeframe and gave us a chance to examine how the crime rate had changed under Brown compared with the year immediately preceding his governorship.",
      "Moorlach correctly points out on Twitter that: \"Your own report admits crime increased from 2011-2015, a very large period of Gov. Brown's time in office.\" He also emphasized this point in a blog post on Medium.com.",
      "As we pointed out in the fact check, the crime rate has fluctuated during Brown's tenure. It increased in 2012 and again in 2015, provoking concern from politicians and those who research crime trends. The other four years under Brown, however, the crime rate has decreased.",
      "In the end, when one measures the overall crime rate from 2010 through 2015 and through 2016, both fuller pictures of Brown's time in office, there's a slight decrease.",

      "Background checks on refugees seeking to enter the United States are among the most stringent in the world.",
      "California Congressman Tom McClintock recently claimed, however, those screenings were anything but strict under the Obama Administration.",
      "\"The vetting was very haphazard,\" McClintock said in a Jan. 31, 2017, interview with Capital Public Radio. \"In many cases, we simply accepted the word of applicants.\"",
      "McClintock is a Republican from the Sacramento area.",
      "In the interview, McClintock said he supports President Donald Trump's immigration order, which temporarily bans all refugees from entering the country and indefinitely bars Syrian refugees.",
      "In addition to the refugee halt, Trump's executive action also suspends immigration for citizens of seven majority Muslim countries for 90 days. They are: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.",
      "McClintock said Trump is rightly taking time to create a new vetting system because, as he put it, Obama's was \"very haphazard.\"",
      "Given the ongoing immigration debate, we decided to fact-check McClintock's statement.",
      "Before we start, here's some background on refugees:",
      "The federal government defines a refugee as any person outside of the U.S. that is of special humanitarian concern to the U.S. and \"has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,\" according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "Trump's executive action affects many categories of immigrants from students to employees to refugees.",
      "Refugees, notably, have not been the primary perpetrators of any of the country's major terror attacks that killed Americans in recent decades. Trump has said his order was necessary to ensure national security.",
      "Our research",
      "When asked about McClintock's claim, Jennifer Cressy, a spokeswoman for the congressman said he was referring to testimony Congress received in 2015 from federal law enforcement that \"the vetting process hinges on the word of the applicant due to lack of reliable documentary proof of identity.\"",
      "That testimony focused on Syrian refugees, which have accounted for a small but growing share of refugees admitted to the country.",
      "As our national partner PolitiFact has reported, there are undoubtedly challenges to vetting refugees. No system is foolproof.",
      "The head of the National Counterterrorism Center told Congress in October 2015 that the intelligence in Syria is \"not as rich as we would like it to be,\" while FBI Director James Comey told Congress that there are \"gaps\" in data availability.",
      "The lack of U.S. relationships with Syrian government and law enforcement and the use of fake passports and fraudulent documents are also causes for concern, Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, told PolitiFact in November 2015. CIS advocates for limited immigration.",
      "There are examples of refugees accepted under Obama who joined, or attempted to join, terror networks in the Middle East after arriving in the United States. Cressy, McClintock's spokeswoman, pointed to Aws Mohammed Younis Al-Jayab, a refugee who after arriving in the U.S. traveled to Syria to fight for the Nusra Front, and then returned to settle in Sacramento. He is awaiting trial on terrorism charges.",
      "There are no examples, however, of any refugee committing fatal terror attacks on U.S. soil since the 1970s. More than three million refugees have arrived in the country since that time, making the odds of an American falling victim to a refugee in a terror attack miniscule, as PolitiFact California recently examined.",
      "McClintock's claims about \"very haphazard vetting\" and that \"we simply accepted the word of applicants\" are overly broad and do not match up with how refugee screenings work.",
      "Refugee advocate responds",
      "Karen Ferguson is executive director of the Northern California International Rescue Committee, which helps resettle refugees in the United States. She responded to McClintock's claim in an interview on Capital Public Radio's Insight show early this month.",
      "\"The idea that it would be haphazard is erroneous,\" Ferguson said. \"The vetting system now takes anywhere from 16 to 36 months. It includes screenings from the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, State Department, the National Counterterrorism Center, FBI, and the U.S. Intelligence Community.\"",
      "\"There have always been multiple interviews, additional interviews,\" Ferguson added. \"So, the vetting process is already there. And this statement that it's been haphazard needs to be countered. It's not true. And (refugee vetting) has been proven to be effective.\"",
      "For a fact-check in November 2015, PolitiFact spoke with experts and advocates who pushed back on the notion that the United States accepts refugees with no intelligence at all. In contrast to refugees worldwide, Syrians tend to have identity documents and the reasons they give for missing documents (i.e. a barrel bomb dropping on their house) can be verified, according to the State Department.",
      "Steps in vetting process",
      "The U.S. refugee admissions process has been in place since 1980 and was strengthened after 9/11.",
      "PolitiFact has outlined its many steps this way:",
      "Before refugees even face U.S. vetting, they must first clear an eligibility hurdle. The United Nations is the main authority that determines who counts as a refugee, who should be resettled (about 1 percent) and which countries would take them. This can take four to 10 months.",
      "Once the cases are referred to the United States, refugees are vetted through a process that involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies. Typically, about half of refugees are turned down, according to the State Department.",
      "Refugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks. Their names, biographical information and fingerprints are run through databases coordinated by the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense.",
      "For Syrian refugees, there's one additional step. Their filings with the UN and initial documents submitted to the U.S. program are reviewed. Information about where they came from, what caused them to flee and what their experiences were like are cross-referenced with classified and unclassified information.",
      "McClintock's claim about \"haphazard vetting\" comes as the U.S. grapples with how to ensure Syrian refugees are fully-vetted. Advocates for the stronger vetting, including the congressman, have described Syria as \"a hot-bed for terrorism.\"",
      "Experts on this process, however, say the United States has successfully vetted refugees from similarly challenging countries in the past.",
      "\"We've also resettled thousands in recent years from the Central African Republic, Somalia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, all of which have faced similar terrorist threats and have unstable governments that present challenges for the vetting process. But we've done this successfully time and time again without incident,\" Geoffrey Mock, the Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, told PolitiFact in 2015.",
      "Our ruling",
      "California Rep. Tom McClintock recently claimed refugee vetting was very haphazard,\" under the Obama Administration. \"In many cases, we simply accepted the word of applicants.\"",
      "Federal law enforcement told Congress in 2015 that there are gaps in the available data for Syrian refugees, which represented a small but growing share of the refugees admitted to the United States under Obama.",
      "All sides in this debate acknowledge no vetting system is foolproof.",
      "McClintock's claim about a \"haphazard system,\" however, ignores the facts.",
      "The United Nations examines refugee applications and designates a small fraction as eligible. From there, refugees under consideration by the U.S. undergo a strict process that can last up to three years and involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies.",
      "Their names, biographical information and fingerprints are run through databases coordinated by the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense.",
      "Of the more than 3 million refugees admitted to the country since 1980, none has carried out a fatal terrorist attack on U.S. soil.",
      "Advocates for the process say this is evidence the vetting works and is already robust.",

      "\"The Oroville dam failure was entirely avoidable: California passed a $7.5 Billion water bond in 2014 but Jerry Brown didn't spend $1 on new water storage or improvements to existing infrastructure like Oroville,\" Allen said in a press release on Feb. 13, 2017.",
      "Allen posted similar claims on Twitter and Facebook the same day.",
      "",
      "The problems at the Oroville dam are complex. And so is Allen's claim. We'll break his statement into parts and assess its overall accuracy.",
      "1) The Oroville dam failure was \"entirely avoidable.\"",
      "Let's be clear: The dam itself hasn't failed. But its main concrete spillway developed a gaping hole in early February 2017 that led officials to dial back water flows to avoid further damage.",
      "As stormwater and runoff continued to flow in, however, the reservoir overtopped its emergency spillway for the first time in its 48-year history.",
      "The emergency spillway includes a concrete lip at the top and wooded hillside below without concrete fortification.",
      "Rapid erosion took place on Feb. 12, 2017 as water rushed down that unprotected hillside, leading to fears of a major dam breach and forcing the evacuation of nearly 200,000 residents downriver.",
      "",
      "Authorities lifted the mandatory evacuation orders two days later, though concerns over the dam's safety are expected to continue for months.",
      "Environmental groups warned in October 2005, when the dam was up for a federal license renewal before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, that the emergency spillway needed to be armored with concrete to avoid a crisis such as the one that played out this week. And a November 2005 Sacramento Bee article quoted state water officials as saying \"Our facilities, including the (emergency) spillway, are safe during any conceivable flood event.\"",
      "The issue of fortifying that hillside \"was brought up in the FERC proceeding,\" Lester Snow, who was director of the state Department of Water Resources from 2004 through 2009, told PolitiFact California this week. \"And I believe FERC, as well as DWR engineers, looked at that and did not consider it to be the kind of threat that it has turned out to be.\"",
      "\"I guess (there's) some credence,\" to the idea that the crisis was avoidable, Snow said. \"(But) again, we would not have gotten there had it not had the surprising and dramatic failure of the (main) concrete gated spillway.\"",
      "The main spillway had passed federal and state inspections and those who manage it \"saw nothing that would have predicted such a failure in the concrete chute,\" said Nancy Vogel, a spokeswoman for the Brown Administration's Natural Resources Agency.",
      "2) \"California passed a $7.5 Billion water bond in 2014\"",
      "California voters did, indeed, pass a $7.5 billion water bond known as Proposition 1 in 2014. It was approved at the height of the state's severe drought with the goal of expanding California's water storage capacity and improving water quality.",
      "It included $2.7 billion for new surface and groundwater storage projects.",
      "3) \"But Jerry Brown didn't spend $1 (from the bond) on new water storage or improvements to existing infrastructure like Oroville.\"",
      "Again, there's some truth in this part of Allen's statement. But there's also a lot of context missing.",
      "State officials said Oroville and other existing State Water Projects are not eligible for Proposition 1 money. Upkeep on the massive system of state reservoirs, dams and aqueducts is paid for by the 29 state water contractors who consume the water, including urban and agricultural water districts.",
      "Asked about using Proposition 1 money for Oroville, H.D. Palmer, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, said: \"You couldn't have done it if you wanted to.\"",
      "Allen's additional claim that Brown hasn't spent any of that bond money on new water storage is also problematic. A spokeswoman for Allen pointed to a state website that tracks Proposition 1 funding and shows none has been allocated for water storage projects.",
      "Brown Administration officials countered that Proposition 1 was not intended to pay for projects overnight. It was a forward-looking measure that aimed to expand and strengthen the state's water system for future droughts.",
      "Vogel, of the state's Natural Resources Agency, said Allen ignores the fact that \"the storage funding section of the bond precluded any money being spent until December 15, 2016. Travis Allen should remember this since he voted for the water bond,\" in the Legislature. The bond passed the Assembly with support from all but two members.",
      "Voters then approved it during the November 2014 election.",
      "The state expects applications for new water storage projects to be submitted later this year. The California Water Commission plans to award early funding for storage projects in 2018, Vogel said.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Assemblyman Travis Allen recently claimed: \"The Oroville dam failure was entirely avoidable: California passed a $7.5 Billion water bond in 2014 but Jerry Brown didn't spend $1 on new water storage or improvements to existing infrastructure like Oroville.\"",
      "State officials say there was no indication of problems with the dam's main spillway, which developed a huge hole this week as officials released large amounts of water from the dam. Officials did, however, have warnings about the integrity of the dam's emergency spillway, which experienced rapid erosion this week, triggering mass evacuations below the dam.",
      "Environmental groups warned in 2005 that the emergency spillway needed to be reinforced.",
      "Given those warnings, there's some truth to Allen's claim that the crisis could have been avoided. But there's no evidence, at this point, that state officials knew the dam's main spillway was in jeopardy, something Allen does not point out.",
      "Allen's other assertion that Gov. Jerry Brown hasn't spent a single dollar from the state's recent $7.5 billion water bond on Oroville also doesn't tell the whole story. That dam, and all others along the State Water Project, are ineligible for those funds. Allen's additional claim that the state has yet to spend bond money on new water storage projects, ignores the fact that that money was precluded from being spent until December 2016.",
      "There's no doubt there's been a massive failure at Oroville. But Allen doesn't prove the emergency was \"entirely avoidable,\" particularly given the restrictions on state water bond money.",
      "Allen's statement includes some aspect of truth. Overall, however, it overflows with misleading claims, ignores critical facts and context that would give a different impression.",

It should be a state situation ... but I believe that the legalization of marijuana other than for medical because I think medical, you know I know people that are very, very sick and for whatever reason the marijuana really helps them - but in terms of marijuana and legalization, I think that should be a state issue, state-by-state.\"",

In April 1990 in an article in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, Trump said the United States should legalize drugs and use the money collected to educate the public on the dangers of drug use. \"We're losing badly the war on drugs,\" Trump said at the time, according to the article. \"You have to legalize drugs to win that war. You have to take the profit away from these drug czars.\"",

      "Our research",
      "Last year, Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law Senate Bill 1322. It decriminalizes prostitution for minors by preventing law enforcement from arresting people under 18 for soliciting sex or loitering with intent to commit prostitution. Supporters of the law said it's designed to treat children involved in prostitution as victims rather than as criminals.",
      "It does nothing, however, to legalize commercial sex acts.",

      "\"I don't care about any amount of legalistic spin that someone wants to put on it. When you decriminalize something, you legalize it,\" Allen said in the radio interview.",
      "After his initial claim in the op-ed that \"prostitution by minors will be legal,\" Allen adds some factual context in his second line by noting law enforcement can't \"arrest\" underage workers for soliciting sex.",
      "A few paragraphs later, however, he wrongly asserts that the new law means law enforcement can't \"interfere\" with minors engaging in prostitution.",
      "The law, in fact, includes provisions that officers who encounter these minors shall report the circumstances to the county child welfare agency as abuse or neglect. It also authorizes officers to take a minor engaged in a commercial sex act into temporary custody under some circumstances, including in the event of immediate physical danger or when medical care is needed.",

      "During the same period, California had the highest poverty rate, 20.6 percent, according to the census' Supplemental Poverty Measure. That study does account for cost-of-living, including taxes, housing and medical costs, and is considered by researchers a more accurate reflection of poverty. For a two-adult, two-child family in California, the poverty threshold was an average of $30,000, depending on the region in the state, according to a 2014 analysis by Public Policy Institute of California.",

      "Democratic Congresswoman Judy Chu of Los Angeles County repeated a deceptive claim about the GOP health care bill last week after it narrowly passed the U.S. House.",
      "Chu said the legislation \"would once again allow being a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition,\" in a press release on May 4, 2017. Chu and all other Democrats in the House opposed the bill, which has an uncertain future in the U.S. Senate.",
      "The national PolitiFact team fact-checked similar claims in the headlines of several blogs and rated them Mostly False. It called the statements \"bombastic\" and \"misleading.\" The Washington Post Fact Checker also rejected this claim, giving it four pinnochios.",
      "PolitiFact noted that some blogs have changed their headlines or issued corrections.",
      "In a written statement on May 10, 2017, Chu said she stands by her claim:",
      "\"While the many fact checks have pointed out that a number of conditions would have to be met first, like state waivers, the fact is that what is currently prohibited has once again become possible thanks to the (American Health Care Act),\" she said.",
      "Summary of PolitiFact's findings",
      "PolitiFact Wisconsin also looked at the national PolitiFact's analysis and summarized it's findings this way:",
      "The GOP bill does not single out any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition.",
      "Conditions stemming from a sexual assault or domestic violence, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or certain sexually transmitted diseases, could be judged to be a pre-existing condition.",
      "States would have the option to allow insurers to charge higher prices to people with an existing condition, possibly making coverage unaffordable.",
      "Here's what's wrong with the claim",
      "Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because a person has a pre-existing medical condition.",
      "Republicans' Affordable Care Act replacement the American Health Care Act, which the House passed May 4 weakens those protections.",
      "These blog posts get at a real problem with the Republican bill if it were to become law. Victims of sexual assault could, conceivably, find themselves in a situation where they can't afford insurance because of medical issues that stem from their assault.",
      "But the headlines that say the GOP bill makes sexual assault a pre-existing condition are hyperbolic based on the what the bill actually says.",
      "They stoke fears that the bill singles out victims of sexual assault, limiting their access to health care specifically.",
      "But the Republican bill doesn't pinpoint any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition; that's something the insurance companies or individual states would decide. As it stands, anyone with a pre-existing condition could face problems.",
      "Problems prior to the Affordable Care Act",
      "The blogs discuss anecdotal stories of women who, prior to the Affordable Care Act, were sexually assaulted and then sought treatment stemming from that assault. Later, when these women tried to purchase health insurance, they were denied coverage.",
      "These women weren't necessarily denied coverage because of the sexual assault; rather, it was because of residual treatment they sought afterward, such as taking HIV-preventative medication or seeing a therapist.",
      "None of the several health insurance experts we consulted were aware of insurance companies with policies that specify \"sexual assault\" or \"rape\" as a condition to consider when evaluating someone's eligibility. But insurance resources did regularly list mental health issues or sexually-transmitted illnesses as pre-existing conditions.",
      "For example, if a person were pricked with a used needle or had consensual sex with someone they later discovered had HIV, that person might also take HIV preventatives. And because they took that medication, they, like some sexual assault victims, might have trouble buying health insurance on the open market.",
      "If a sexual assault victim chose not to seek medical treatment, he or she wouldn't necessarily face the same challenge in getting insurance.",
      "\"This is not something specific about sexual assault,\" said Urban Institute senior fellow Linda Blumberg. \"But to the extent victims of sexual assault are needing to take this (HIV) medication, they're very vulnerable in terms of getting insurance coverage in the future.\"",
      "What repealing the Affordable Care Act could mean",
      "The Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent authority on health policy, recently wrote policy papers about pre-existing conditions prior to the Affordable Care Actand how repealing the law would affect women. Neither of those two articles say sexual assault victims would face a particular challenge.",
      "The Republicans' bill doesn't change what is or is not a pre-existing condition.",
      "What it does is allow more consideration of pre-existing conditions than is permitted under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "\"The bill just leaves it to the imagination at this point,\" Blumberg said, referring to what insurance companies might consider as a pre-existing condition.",
      "To be clear, the bill doesn't allow insurance providers to deny coverage to someone based on pre-existing conditions outright. But with a waiver, states can allow providers to set premium costs based on an individual's \"health status.\" Even though the bill puts in some protections, health economists say this could make insurance unaffordable for those with pre-existing conditions.",
      "Before the Affordable Care Act, health insurance companies were not transparent about what counts as a pre-existing condition, and the House Republican replacement doesn't change that, said Kathryn Votava, president of health care consulting company Goodcare.",
      "This allows for the real possibility that sexual assault victims who seek medical treatment could face challenges in getting health insurance if the Republican bill becomes law, she said.",
      "\"Could\" is the key word.",
      "What ultimately happens depends on whether the bill is changed in the Senate and how states and insurance companies respond.",
      "The lack of transparency, as well as the potential for different policies from state to state, would put a significant burden on consumers trying to figure out whether they can obtain insurance given their health status, said Claire Brindis, director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California San Francisco.",
      "For victims of sexual assault in particular, the bill could have a chilling effect, she added. Women might choose not to seek medical treatment after an assault because they are concerned it might affect their ability to get health insurance down the line.",
      "Sexual assault \"is the tip of the iceberg,\" Brindis said. \"There are many many other examples of unexpected events that occur in day to day life, that you can't plan for, can't avoid.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Various bloggers, and some members of Congress, wrote that under the House Republican health plan, sexual assault and domestic violence is a pre-existing condition.",
      "Several websites have since softened their headlines to be more careful, going from \"would\" to \"could.\"",
      "The bill does not change what is or is not a pre-existing condition; the health insurance companies write those definitions for themselves. The House bill also does not single out sexual assault or any other medical issue as a pre-existing condition.",
      "Prior to the Affordable Care Act, some victims of sexual assault said they had trouble getting health insurance because they sought medical services that the insurance companies viewed as evidence of a pre-existing condition, such as for sexually transmitted illness or mental health.",
      "The Republican bill might make it harder for people who have pre-existing conditions to get affordable health care coverage. Victims of sexual assault would face the same challenge as others with pre-existing conditions. But we don't know for sure given the bill's current form.",
      "PolitiFact National rated this claim Mostly False.",
      "Following the same analysis, PolitiFact California rates Chu's claim Mostly False.",
      "MOSTLY FALSE The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",

      "\"As it stands today, anybody with a preexisting condition is protected thanks to the Affordable Care Act. This includes women, who were previously charged more for a range of care that is, today, considered essential'. The AHCA makes it easier for insurers to earn waivers to charge more for preexisting conditions and leaves the question of what should be covered up to others. In my statement, I said that this bill would once again allow a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition.' While the many fact checks have pointed out that a number of conditions would have to be met first, like state waivers, the fact is that what is currently prohibited has once again become possible thanks to the AHCA. We should not even be discussing how women can be charged more for their care, even if it requires 2, 3, or 4 extra steps.

      "It's become a well-worn talking point for GOP gubernatorial candidate Travis Allen: Californians overwhelmingly oppose' sanctuary state policies. The problem? The claim is simply not backed up by the facts.",
      "We handed out a False rating when Allen made the assertion on Fox News on Jan. 2, 2018. We found four recent polls that contradicted Allen's statement. They showed Californians generally favor cities having the ability to declare themselves sanctuaries. Two specifically found greater support than opposition for California's sanctuary state law, which limits state and local law enforcement from cooperating with federal authorities on immigration holds, under some circumstances.",
      "Then Allen made similar claims during a Feb. 1, 2018 interview on Capital Public Radio.",
      "\"Californians are overwhelmingly against this concept of the illegal sanctuary state, which simply put is sheltering people in this state who are here illegally and committing crimes while they are here with taxpayer dollars. I got to tell you, you walk down the street and ask any Californian, nobody agrees with that idea.\"",
      "One of the top issues in California, he added later in the interview, \"is this illegal sanctuary state, which I would tell you the overwhelming majority of Californians disagree with.\"",
      "We examined his recent statements to see if they line up with our past False rating.",
      "\"I don't care which poll you look at\"",
      "Allen has pointed to a 2015 UC Berkeley survey to back up his assertion, correctly noting one response in that poll found 74 percent of respondents opposed sanctuary policies.",
      "But he continues to dismiss findings in more recent surveys that contradict his claim, including a 2017 poll by the same UC Berkeley group. On Jan. 11, 2018 during a talk at the Public Policy Institute of California, he said, \"I don't care which poll you look at, whether it's a 2015 poll or a 2017 poll, Californians do not believe in sheltering people who are here in the state illegally that are committing crimes while they're here with taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "Allen's campaign spokeswoman has described the 2015 UC Berkeley poll as \"the most accurate and appropriate to use.\" She has claimed the 2017 poll \"was biased\" and \"adds politics and inaccurate descriptions of sanctuary policies into the poll.\"",
      "Some might take issue with how Allen characterized the law, particularly the idea that the state is sheltering people who are \"committing crimes.\"",
      "Even so, 53 percent in the most recent survey on the topic, published in November 2017 by USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times, favored California's sanctuary state legislation when asked \"Do you favor or oppose the new law that says California law enforcement personnel will not hand over immigrants in the country illegally to U.S. immigration agents, unless the person has committed a serious crime?\" Twenty-nine percent were opposed.",
      "That doesn't fit with Allen's claim \"nobody agrees with\" the policy or that Californians are \"overwhelmingly against\" it.",
      "Ignoring key context",
      "We also found Allen's statements ignores some key context. Here's more about what the law does and doesn't do, as outlined by the Los Angeles Times in October 2017 when Gov. Brown signed the sanctuary state law:",
      "\"The new law will largely prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from using either personnel or funds to hold, question or share information about people with federal immigration agents unless those individuals have been convicted of one or more offenses from a list of 800 crimes outlined in a 2013 state law.\"",
      "\"Federal immigration authorities will still be able to work with state corrections officials a key concession Brown had demanded and will be able to enter county jails to question immigrants.\"",

      "\"You should be in the top 10 not the bottom 10,\" she added. \"But guess what, you're No. 1 in per prisoner expenditure. That's a disgrace. Budgets are statements of values. And to look at our budget, you'd think prisons were more important than education.\"",

      "Eastin makes her claim at about the 46:00 minute mark in the town hall.",
      "Was Eastin right about those rankings? We decided to fact check her per student vs. per prisoner spending comparison.",
      "41st in per student spending?",
      "To support the first part of the statement, Eastin's campaign pointed to a January 2017 report by the California Budget and Policy Center. The nonprofit, which is described in some media reports as left-leaning, analyzes how budget and tax policies affect low- and middle-income Californians.",
      "Its report found \"California ranked 41st among all states in spending per K-12 student after adjusting for differences in the cost of living in each state.\" It used data from the 2015-16 fiscal year.",
      "California schools spent $10,291 per K-12 student that year, or about $1,900 less than the $12,252 per student spent by the nation as a whole, the report said. Notably, California's per student spending was up about $2,000 from the 2012-13 fiscal year, when the state ranked 50th in the nation.",
      "Jonathan Kaplan, the report's author and a senior policy analyst at the center, told us the report applies a wage-based index to account for California's high teacher salaries. This adjustment, he said, allows for a valid spending comparison between states that pay employees much less.",
      "Clarifications missing",
      "Eastin's statement does not clarify that the 41st in the nation ranking includes an adjustment for cost-of-living. Nor does she mention that California's per pupil spending has moved up the rankings in recent years.",
      "The budget center is not the only group that ranks per pupil spending.",
      "EdWeek, a publication that covers K-12 education, ranked California 46th in per student spending, also using a cost of living adjustment. It's most recent ranking, however, uses older data, from 2013-14, that doesn't account for recent state spending increases.",
      "By contrast, the National Education Association conducts a straight spending comparison. It placed California's per pupil spending at 22nd for 2015-16.",
      "In February 2017, EdSource.org published an in-depth look at the ways California's per pupil spending has been ranked by different groups.",
      "It summarized its findings this way:",
      "\"Since 2011-12, the low point in funding following the 2007-08 recession, California has increased K-12 funding by more than $20 billion. As a result, its average per-student spending has significantly increased, and its ranking among the states has improved in the three most frequently cited studies.",
      "But there's a big variation in the state's ranking among the three because they use different methods and different data. California has moved up some but continues to be in the bottom fifth of states, according to Education Week and the California Budget and Policy Center, while the National Education Association places California near the middle.\"",
      "Per prisoner spending",
      "To support Eastin's claim that California is \"No. 1 in per prisoner expenditure,\" her campaign directed us to a June 2017 Associated Press article that describes those costs as \"the nation's highest.\" It said California's per-inmate cost was expected to climb to $75,560 in the next year.",
      "\"Since 2015, California's per-inmate costs have surged nearly $10,000, or about 13%. New York is a distant second in overall costs at about $69,000,\" the AP reported.",
      "In August 2017, PolitiFact California rated Mostly True Sen. Kamala Harris' claim \"it costs $75,000 per year\" to lock up an inmate in the state, based in part on the AP article and state budget estimates.",
      "We found several reasons for the dramatic cost increase. Most notable is California's sharp drop in inmates combined with higher corrections spending, resulting from greater state contributions to prison employee pensions.",
      "The inmate drop is driven by a 2009 U.S. Supreme Court order for California to reduce prison overcrowding. California's prison population reached a peak of 163,000 inmates in 2006, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. The state estimates it will house an average of about 119,000 prisoners this year.",
      "Meanwhile, there's been no corresponding reduction in prison staff as inmate number have fallen, causing per capita costs to spike.",
      "Jeffrey Callison, a state prisons spokesman, told us the conditions of the court order prevent California from closing prisons even as the inmate population is reduced.",
      "\"So long as the order is in effect we cannot close prisons because to do so would reduce our capacity, thereby pushing us back above 137.5 percent\" level of prison crowding, Callison said in an email. That level is tied to prison capacity and defined by the court, he said.",
      "Prisoner cost to keep climbing",
      "Looking ahead, the per inmate cost is expected to go up again -- to $80,729 -- under Gov. Jerry Brown's proposed 2018-19 budget released this month.",
      "PolitiFact California could not immediately obtain current per prisoner cost estimates for the state of New York. Various rankings have listed New York as No. 1 for per prisoner costs, including a Vera Institute of Justice report using the earlier 2015 data.",
      "Christian Henrichson, research director at the Vera Institute, told us by email that California and New York \"are neck and neck on this measure, and the answer may depend on the year studied.\"",
      "California's continued per prisoner cost spike \"would place CA in the top spot,\" Jon Murchinson, Eastin's campaign spokesman, asserted in an email.",
      "While we don't have all the exact figures, that's a fairly safe bet.",
      "Though per capita inmate costs continue to climb, that doesn't mean California spends more on prisons than K-12 education, as some might take from Eastin's claim. The reverse is correct: Gov. Jerry Brown's current general fund budget projects spending 42 percent, or $55 billion, on the K-12 system. Meanwhile, it proposes spending 9 percent, or about $12 billion, on the prison system.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Candidate for governor Delaine Eastin recently claimed California ranks 41st in per pupil K-12 spending but is \"No. 1 in per prisoner\" spending.",
      "She relied on a January 2017 policy center report that backs up the per pupil spending ranking, after adjusting for cost of living. Another ranking that makes a straight spending comparison puts California at 22nd for per pupil spending. Eastin did not make this clear in her statement nor did she note that California's per student spending has increased in recent years.",
      "Eastin's claim that California is No. 1 for per prisoner costs is backed up by a 2017 Associated Press report, which listed New York a distant second. While we could not immediately find current figures for New York, we discovered that California's per prisoner costs are expected to again rise -- to more than $80,000 -- in the next fiscal year, several thousand dollars higher than in recent years.",
      "Overall, Eastin's comparison is supported by recent studies. But her statement could use clarifying information.",

      "They cite a separate law, AB 60, that allows undocumented Californians to apply for and obtain a state driver's license, as alleged proof.",
      "This World Net Daily headline on Jan. 21, 2018 sparked the recent claims: \"California To Register Illegal Aliens To Vote Automatically.\"",
      "",
      "Shortly after it was published, similar allegations were made by The New American, FoxNews.com and conservative commentators Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh.",
      "This isn't the first wave of commentary on the topic. Similar statements were made when California passed the Motor Voter program in 2015.",
      "But because the claims popped up again this week, it's time to take another look at the California laws in question and the safeguards state officials say are in place.",
      "We'll also place a rating on the claim by World Net Daily.",
      "Background on the laws",
      "Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed AB 60 in 2013, making California the 10th state to allow driver licenses for people in the country illegally. The goal was to increase public safety and reduce penalties for undocumented immigrants who drive. As of June 2017, the state Department of Motor Vehicles had issued more than 900,000 of the licenses.",
      "In 2015, Brown signed the New Motor Voter law. By April, it will automatically register DMV customers to vote when they renew or obtain a driver's license or fill out change of address forms, unless the customer opts-out.",
      "Under the law, the DMV would electronically send information for those eligible to register to vote -- which does not include undocumented residents -- to the California Secretary of State's Office. That office would, in turn, verify name and citizenship information. A spokesman for that office did not respond to requests for comment this week.",
      "In the past, however, Secretary of State Alex Padilla has pledged the new system will be an improvement over the existing one.",
      "\"Automated voter registration is actually a more secure way of doing things,\" Padilla told the Huffington Post in 2015. Potential voters \"have to demonstrate proof of age, the vast majority of time people are showing a birth certificate or a passport, which also reflects citizenship. That's arguably more secure than someone checking a box under penalty of perjury.\"",
      "\"Completely inaccurate\" claims",
      "Jessica Gonzalez, spokeswoman with the California DMV, said she's contacted several of the websites making what she called \"completely inaccurate\" claims and asked for corrections. One, the Daily Mail, had pulled down its story, another updated its article, while she said Fox News did not immediately correct its article.",
      "\"Undocumented Californians are not eligible to register to vote at the DMV,\" Gonzalez told PolitiFact California. \"And we have programming measures in place to prevent that from occurring.\"",
      "At DMV field offices, Gonzalez said, technicians will not be able to key in any voting information for undocumented customers seeking AB 60 license renewals.",
      "As soon as a technician types in AB 60, the voter information section automatically gets \"greyed out\" and can't be typed into and can't be bypassed, the spokeswoman said. She added that the same safeguards are in place for online and mail renewals.",
      "\"The (mail) form won't even have the voter information questions on it, so they won't be able to register to vote,\" Gonzalez said.",
      "\"It's really interesting how quickly false information spreads,\" she continued, \"and how difficult it is to get the correct information out there to Californians that really need to know this information.\"",
      "A representative for World Net Daily could not be reached for comment.",
      "Several fact-checking websites, from Snopes.com to The Weekly Standard, a conservative publication, examined the topic this week.",
      "The Weekly Standard concluded \"there is zero evidence to support that ludicrous claim.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Conservative news websites and commentators claimed California plans to register undocumented immigrants to vote.",
      "This isn't the first time such unsubstantiated claims have been made. But the recent spat was sparked by the World Net Daily headline: \"California To Register Illegal Aliens To Vote Automatically.\"",
      "In reality, the California law that goes into effect in April 2018 will automatically register only those eligible to vote when they renew or obtain a driver's license. Undocumented immigrants are excluded. The law does nothing to change the federal requirement that one must be a U.S. citizen to register to vote.",
      "State officials said safeguards are already in place to prevent state DMV workers from typing in any voter information for AB 60 license holders. The state allows unauthorized immigrants to obtain a driver's license, but explicitly excludes that group from the automatic voter registration.",
      "The allegations on this topic are recycled. And they're still blatantly untrue.",
      "We rate World Net Daily's claim Pants On Fire.",
      "PANTS ON FIRE The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.",
      "UPDATE: After we published our fact check, World Net Daily published a separate article saying a spokeswoman for the California Department of Motor Vehicles \"cleared up an inaccuracy in WND's initial report.\" It said the spokeswoman explained that California's licenses for undocumented immigrants \"are not eligible for the new voter registration system.\" As of Jan. 29, 2018, World Net Daily had not updated its original report with this information."

      "Doubt",
      "An Oct. 19, 2011, story by the St. Petersburg Times said naturalization records showed Rubio's parents, Mario and Oriales, became U.S. residents in May 1956.",
      "At that time, Castro lived in Mexico after a failed 1953 attack on army barracks in Santiago de Cuba. Cubans lived under the dictatorship of Batista, who had seized power as he ran for re-election in 1952. The nation, which enjoyed high literacy, a strong educational system even the world's fifth-highest number of TVs per capita found itself ruled by decree.",
      "In May 1956, the Rubio family would fly to the United States. Castro returned to mount his revolution in December. More than two years would pass before Batista fled on Jan. 1, 1959.",
      "In 2006, Rubio, the young soon-to-be speaker of the Florida House, would recount the takeover: \"In January of 1959, a thug named Fidel Castro took power in Cuba, and countless Cubans were forced to flee.\"",
      "To many, he seemed to count his own family among them.",
      "And in 2009 and 2010, he told reporters dates that made that possible. News stories called the lawmaker, himself born in the United States in 1971, the son of \"exiles from Castro's Cuba.\" Some used a specific date: 1959.",
      "Story shift",
      "In September 2011, Rubio chatted with Miami Herald reporter Marc Caputo for a story about his upcoming autobiography. They talked about Rubio's parents' immigration from Cuba. Caputo, later recounting his notes, said Rubio \"struggled to recall the year ... and said it was in ' '57 or '58 or '59.' \"",
      "\"When asked pointedly: Was it before the revolution? Rubio said it was before the revolution,\" Caputo wrote in an Oct. 20 blog post.",
      "Caputo included the detail in his September story, saying Rubio was, \"the son of Cuban immigrants who left Cuba just before the 1959 revolution.\"",
      "When we searched for news references to Rubio's parents, we found the new account differed from dozens of articles about Rubio's past, his own TV interviews, and his official campaign and Senate bios.",
      "And Rubio's bio didn't change.",
      "After the Times and the Washington Post wrote about the discrepancy, Rubio released a statement.",
      "\"The dates I have given regarding my family's history have always been based on my parents' recollections of events that occurred over 55 years ago and which were relayed to me by them more than two decades after they happened,\" he wrote on Oct. 20. \"I was not made aware of the exact dates until very recently.\"",
      "Asked about Rubio's official bio the next day, spokesman Alex Conant confirmed, \"the dates were wrong.\"",
      "\"We just recently became aware of it, and it just hadn't been updated,\" he said. (The site updated the evening of Oct. 21, 2011 to say: \"Marco was born in Miami in 1971 to Cuban exiles who first arrived in the United States in 1956.\")",
      "Rubio learned the full story talking with his mom, Conant said, and looking at his parents' passports. (His father died in September 2010.)",
      "Instead of fleeing Castro's Cuba, the Rubios came to the United States for \"economic opportunity,\" Conant said.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Several times during his race for U.S. Senate, Rubio told reporters and voters his parents left Cuba in 1959, suggesting they had fled Castro's rule. In his campaign bio, and later in his official Senate biography, he said his parents \"came to America following Fidel Castro's takeover.\"",
      "Even after he stumbled over dates with a Miami Herald reporter and acknowledged his parents left before the revolution, his official Web bio stayed the same. After two news organizations reported his parents moved to the United States in 1956, his spokesman acknowledged that the bio was wrong. It was updated to say, \"Marco was born in Miami in 1971 to Cuban exiles who first arrived in the United States in 1956.\" That puts everyone in agreement: The original statement is False."

      "Unfortunately, the email is riddled with errors, starting with the fact that is referring to an initial 2009 health care proposal that never became law. Still, because it has the subject line \"Obama Care Outrage,\" we thought people might confuse it with the health care law on the books.",

      "Let us explain.",
      "The Affordable Care Act contains an individual mandate that requires individuals to purchase health insurance. It allows U.S. citizens and legal residents to purchase insurance on health insurance exchanges, often receiving tax credits.",
      "But none of it applies to people who are here illegally. They don't have to follow the mandate because they shouldn't be here. They remain ineligible for regular Medicaid coverage, just as they are ineligible for food stamps. They cannot obtain coverage through state-based health insurance exchanges (thus, they are also ineligible for tax credits to offset the cost of getting that coverage).",
      "Now, certain low-income illegal immigrants are eligible for emergency Medicaid coverage, including childbirth and surgery. And federal law requires hospitals not to turn away individuals for emergency treatment, even if they are uninsured (or undocumented), according to the National Immigration Law Center.",
      "But those policies predate the Affordable Care Act.",
      "\"They don't get health insurance, which is coverage, which is different than a hospital getting reimbursed for Medicaid,\" said Laura Goodhue, executive director of Florida Chain, a consumer health advocacy group.",
      "The Affordable Care Act does provide some benefits for certain legal non-U.S. citizens. We repeat: Legal.",
      "Immigrants who are in the country legally are subject to the mandate and are eligible to shop on the exchanges.",
      "Thanks to the Supreme Court and Florida legislators, certain poor, legal noncitizens have it a little easier in Florida than the state's most impoverished citizens. The law includes a special rule (page 108) allowing them to get tax credits to purchase health insurance on an exchange if they (a) do not qualify for Medicaid because they have not been here for the required five years and (b) earn at or below the poverty line.",
      "Meanwhile, about 1 million of Florida's poorest citizens will continue not to have affordable access to health insurance. They are not eligible to receive tax credits for the exchanges, and Florida leaders did not expand Medicaid coverage to include them during the 2013 legislative session.",
      "Goodhue calls it a \"black hole\" of coverage.",
      "Republican Gov. Jan Brewer had noticed a similar scenario playing out in Arizona if its leaders did not expand Medicaid, saying, \"For poor Arizonans below 100 percent of the federal poverty level, only legal immigrants, but not citizens, would be eligible for subsidies.\"",

He lost the right to accuse Democrats of raiding Medicare when he oversaw the largest Medicare fraud in the nation's history.

      "Separately, we have fact-checked Scott's claim \"we are seeing dramatic rate cuts\" to Medicare that will affect people's choice of doctor, hospital and preventive care. We concluded that Scott had failed to say that the rate cut only applies to Medicare Advantage, and thus only affects a fraction of all Medicare beneficiaries. Also, it could be several months before we know the actual impact of the cut which could vary county by county. We rated Scott's claim Mostly False.",

      "During Scott's 2010 race for governor, PolitiFact fact-checked multiple claims related to his tenure at Columbia/HCA. Now, we'll recap some of our earlier discussion of the investigation and fine.",
      "Scott started what was first Columbia in 1987, purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. Over the next decade he would add hundreds of hospitals, surgery centers and home health locations. In 1994, Scott's Columbia purchased Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals, and merged the companies.",
      "In 1997, federal agents went public with an investigation into the company, first seizing records from four El Paso-area hospitals and then expanding across the country. The investigation focused on whether Columbia/HCA had committed Medicare and Medicaid fraud.",
      "Scott resigned as CEO in July 1997, less than four months after the inquiry became public. Company executives said had Scott remained CEO, the entire chain could have been in jeopardy.",
      "During his 2010 race, the Miami Herald reported that Scott had said he would have immediately stopped his company from committing fraud -- if only \"somebody told me something was wrong.\" But there were such warnings in the company's annual public reports to stockholders -- which Scott had to sign as president and CEO.",
      "Scott wanted to fight the accusations, but the corporate board of the publicly traded company wanted to settle.",
      "In December 2000, the U.S. Justice Department announced that Columbia/HCA agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines, civil damages and penalties.",
      "Among the revelations from the 2000 settlement:",
      "Columbia billed Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal programs for tests that were not necessary or had not been ordered by physicians;",
      "The company attached false diagnosis codes to patient records to increase reimbursement to the hospitals;",
      "The company illegally claimed non-reimbursable marketing and advertising costs as community education;",
      "Columbia billed the government for home health care visits for patients who did not qualify to receive them.",
      "The government settled a second series of similar claims with Columbia/HCA in 2002 for an additional $881 million. The total for the two fines was $1.7 billion.",
      "On Scott's 2010 campaign website, he admitted to the $1.7 billion fine, though the link is no longer on the site.",
      "What type of record was that fine?",
      "The fine clearly set a record, though the Justice Department (and media reports at the time) were not always consistent in their terminology, sometimes describing it as the \"largest government fraud settlement in U.S. History\" and other times more specifically as the \"largest health care fraud case in U.S. History.\"",
      "A Justice Department spokeswoman said that officials refer to Columbia/HCA as \"largest health care fraud\" rather than the more narrow term \"Medicare fraud\" because it involved defrauding other government programs such as Medicaid rather than Medicare exclusively. The Justice Department described in detail the various ways the company defrauded Medicare and other government health programs here.",
      "Here's a key point, though: While the Columbia/HCA settlement was a record at the time for health care fraud, it has since been surpassed. In cases related to the improper promotion of certain drugs, Johnson & Johnson agreed to a a $2.2 billion settlement in 2013, Pfizer settled for $2.3 billion in 2009, and GlaxoSmithKline settled for $3 billion in 2012.",
      "\"HCA was the record health care fraud at the time. It's now Glaxo,\" Justice Department spokeswoman Linda Mansour told PolitiFact in an email.",
      "That said, these cases were a little different. While the Justice Department's case against Columbia/HCA repeatedly mentions overbilling and defrauding Medicare and Medicaid specifically, the three newer cases focused on the marketing of drugs, with Medicare, Medicaid and other federal programs caught up in the impropriety, rather than being the specific targets of the fraud.",
      "Because the Justice Department press releases explaining the settlements don't explicitly break down how much of the misconduct in those more recent cases defrauded Medicare explicitly, it's difficult to make comparisons.",
      "The Pfizer case includes violations relating to misbranding and kickbacks, \"so there may be a distinction to be made for that reason when thinking about whether it all should be classified under the very general category of Medicare fraud,' \" said Asha Scielzo, who practices health care law at the firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman.",
      "The Columbia/HCA case \"still is the largest fraud settlement for a hospital corporation in U.S. history,\" since all the others involved pharmaceutical firms, added Zack Buck, a health care law professor at Mercer. \"So I guess, the quote (by the Florida Democratic Party) is a little loose.\"",
      "The Scott campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this fact-check. However in 2010, Scott told the Tampa Bay Times, \"There's no question that mistakes were made and as CEO, I have to accept responsibility for those mistakes. I was focused on lowering costs and making the hospitals more efficient. I could have had more internal and external controls. I learned hard lessons, and I've taken that lesson and it's helped me become a better business person and a better leader.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "The Florida Democratic Party said Scott \"oversaw the largest Medicare fraud in the nation's history.\"",
      "The Columbia/HCA settlement has since been surpassed in dollar value, though the bigger cases involved Medicare somewhat less directly.

      "But there are other ways that Senators can influence legislation even if they don't end up as the sponsor of the final version:",
      "Co-sponsored bills: There were 74 bills that became law that Clinton co-sponsored. For example, she was one of 54 cosponsors on the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, signed in January 2009 by President Barack Obama. (The fact that she co-sponsored these bills doesn't tell us much about her role in their passage, but Bush referred to bills that \"she has her name\" on, so it's worth noting those she co-sponsored.)",

      "\"Offering amendments on the floor, holding hearings, contributing to oversight, helping to negotiate agreements, pushing federal agencies to be responsive to constituents back home -- all of these might contribute to making a senator effective,' but none of these endeavors of course would show up in a count of bills sponsored or passed or enacted,\" Binder said.",
      "As for Bush's claim about the number of laws \"she has her name on,\" Binder said that it's fair game to also look at the number of bills Clinton co-sponsored.",
      "\"Because have her name on' is so vague, I don't see the grounds on which to exclude co-sponsored bills,\" she said.",
      "Ornstein said that the names that go on bills of any real significance are the committee chairs -- for example the Dodd-Frank 2010 banking reform bill. Sen. Chris Dodd and U.S. Rep. Barney Frank were the major figures behind the law, but other senators also had roles and don't have their names on the bill.",
      "Meanwhile, the Affordable Care Act \"does not have Al Franken's name on it, but a really important provision, the medical-loss ratio, was his handiwork,\" Ornstein said. \"Effectiveness can be a behind-the-scenes role, adding a serious amendment, working inside to get the language exactly right. By any reasonable standard, including the private comments of her colleagues on both sides of the aisle when she was in the Senate, she was very effective.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Bush said that as a senator, Clinton had her name \"on three laws in eight years.\"",

      "More and more, critics are making the case that keeping killer whales in captivity is harmful to the animals and dangerous for the people who train them. SeaWorld, the theme park that showcases the trained whales, is now fighting back.",
      "A new ad, part of a multimedia blitz for the company, is headlined, \"Fact: Whales live as long at SeaWorld,\" and it is written in the voice of Chris Dold, a SeaWorld veterinarian. The ad, which has appeared in the Tampa Bay Times, takes specific aim at criticism leveled by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, an animal-rights group that has been among the theme park company's biggest critics. Here's a portion of the ad's text:",
      "\"You might have heard attacks from PETA saying our killer whales live only a fraction as long as whales in the wild. They say, In captivity, orcas' average life span plummets to just nine years.' But the author of an independent study, Dr. Douglas DeMaster, of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as saying, Survival in the wild is comparable to survival in captivity.' There's no other way to say it PETA is not giving you the facts.\"",
      "PETA, meanwhile, pushed back against the ad's conclusions, citing the average age of whales that have died since 1965. According to PETA's documentation of captive whale deaths, the average age of death is 12 years old for SeaWorld's female orcas -- which are expected to survive in the wild for about 50 years. For males -- which are expected to survive in the wild for 30 years -- the average age of death is 16.",
      "SeaWorld currently has in its care several whales in their 30s and one in its 40s.",
      "Keeping whales in captivity is a complicated issue, and the critical 2013 documentary Blackfish has brought more attention to it. Clearly, longevity is just one factor, and it isn't the same thing as the quality of the whales' daily lives. Here, though, we wanted to drill down on SeaWorld's specific claim that the whales at their parks live just as long as they do in the wild.",
      "SeaWorld's evidence",
      "We posed SeaWorld's claim to DeMaster, the scientist quoted in the ad. He's the science director of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, an office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a federal government agency. Most of the independent experts we contacted agreed that DeMaster is the key scientist to ask about this issue.",
      "DeMaster said that SeaWorld is correct -- \"as long as you use data from 2005 to 2013.\" (PETA's data, by contrast, goes back 40 more years.)",
      "On three occasions -- in 1988, 1995 and 2013 -- DeMaster has compiled data that comprehensively compared survival among captive and wild marine mammals.",
      "In the 1988 and 1995 papers, DeMaster found differences in the survival rates of marine mammals, including killer whales (also called orcas), depending on whether they lived in the wild or in captivity. The 1995 paper, for instance, found that captive orcas had a 94 percent chance of surviving to the next year in captivity, compared to 98 percent in the wild.",
      "That changed by the time DeMaster completed his latest research, in 2013. By then, he found, the annual survival rate for both captive and non-captive killer whales had converged at 98 percent.",
      "\"According to recent information there was an improvement in the annual survival rate, to quite close to what you might see in the wild,\" DeMaster told PolitiFact.",
      "DeMaster cautioned that he's not sure of the reason for the improvement in survival, and he said he doesn't take a position on whether or not large mammals should be kept in captivity.",
      "Meanwhile, an Associated Press analysis also cited in the SeaWorld ad -- which is based on the same data DeMaster used, the federal government's Marine Mammal Inventory Report -- found that the average life expectancy for a killer whale born at SeaWorld was 46 years, which it said was close to the 49-year average life expectancy of a wild orca.",
      "Critiquing the SeaWorld evidence",
      "So SeaWorld has support for its claim. But the company glosses over some important caveats.",
      "None of the statistical comparisons take into account quality of life, as opposed to length of life. Science is better at measuring longevity than it is at judging how humane a life in captivity is.",
      "The mathematical approach \"is totally irrelevant,\" said Dave Duffus, an associate professor of geography at Canada's University of Victoria, who participated on the panel with DeMaster in New Zealand. \"To me the important variable is not how long, rather it is how well, which isn't a scientific question as much as it is a logical question. Everything about the quality of captive life is in opposition to the wild, which is the product of thousands of generations of natural selection.\"",
      "Merely reaching parity with wild populations isn't necessarily a major achievement. Simple logic would suggest several reasons why marine mammals should live longer in captivity. Captive animals don't have to worry about predators, food shortages, fishing nets, or pollution, and they're given nutritional supplements, vaccines and veterinary care.",
      "\"It would sort of make sense that any animal given better medical and nutritional care would live just as long, or longer, than one not given this sort of care,\" said Paul Nachtigall, director of the Marine Mammal Research Program at the University of Hawaii.",
      "The ad focuses on longevity, not survival rates; those are different statistics. The ad's headline refers to how long whales live, and the text uses terms like \"life span\" and \"life expectancy.\" But those are different things than the statistic DeMaster used that's favorable to SeaWorld -- annual survival rates.",
      "Many experts, including DeMaster, told PolitiFact that annual survival rates are better measurements than longevity. Whales have not been in captivity long enough to know whether they are able to live a full-length life in that setting, DeMaster told PolitiFact. They've only been in captivity since the 1960s.",
      "Jaap van der Toom, a Dutch biologist who has studied marine mammals, has made a similar point. \"Longevity is basically an incidental finding: it is determined by the oldest animal you find in your sample,\" he has written. \"You can only determine the longevity of a group of animals after all the members of that group have died.\"",
      "Well before SeaWorld released its ad, van der Toom published a cheat sheet about how to spin statistics. Referring to the same group of animals, he said, you could use different statistics to paint opposite appraisals. \"If you want to paint a positive picture,\" you could say that \"the life expectancy is 19.5 years\" or \"the majority of the animals will become older than 13 years,\" he wrote. In effect, that's the approach SeaWorld took. But if you wanted to offer a negative spin, you would say that \"within five years, 23 percent of the animals will have died,\" or that \"one-third of the animals will survive no longer than eight years,\" or \"within 14 years, 50 percent of the animals will be dead.\"",
      "Van der Toom summed up: \"To paraphrase an old song: \" t ain't what you say, it's the way that you say it.\"",
      "The data on wild orca populations is sparse. There is data on whale life spans from the Pacific Northwest, but there are orcas all over the world, and there's no guarantee that all of them have similar life spans and survival rates.",
      "In the 1995 paper, DeMaster cautioned that \"comparisons between survival in captivity with survival in the wild will remain tenuous until additional demographic studies are conducted on wild populations.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "A SeaWorld ad said \"whales live as long at SeaWorld\" as they do in the wild.",
      "At its core, this claim is an oversimplification of a much more complex issue. Recent independent data suggests that survival rates for captive and wild orcas are about equal, but that by itself isn't all that significant, experts told us. The data is limited and comparisons between orcas in captivity and in the wild are tenuous. Experts also noted that logic suggests captive whales should live longer because they don't face predators and receive medical care, which makes SeaWorld's claim further misleading.",
      "Lastly, experts said that a simple measurement of survival rates (or lifespan) serves as a smokescreen from the more fundamental question of the conditions for whales in captivity.",

      "Florida is one of only a handful of states left in the country that doesn't allow any open carry of firearms, and some state legislators want to change that.",
      "State Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, is sponsoring a bill that would allow those with a conceal carry license to openly carry their firearms. On Oct. 6, 2015, a House panel voted in favor of the bill, which will now advance to other committees in anticipation of a January legislative session.",
      "In a press conference before the hearing, Gaetz tried to allay fears that public safety would suffer by comparing crime rates in states without open carry with those that allow it.",
      "\"It is important to note that in the states that allow open carry, violent crime was 23 percent lower, the murder rate was 5 percent lower, the aggravated assault rate was 23 percent lower and robbery rates were 36 percent lower.\"",
      "We decided to fact-check his claim that violent crime was 23 percent lower in open carry states. The statistic suggests that open carry laws make states safer, or at the very least don't make them more dangerous. But the reality is much more complex, according to experts and research.",
      "Comparing states on violent crime rate",
      "Gaetz used Uniform Crime Reporting figures compiled by the U.S. Department of Justice to create his statistics. The data come 2012.",
      "He divided the states into two groups the eight states that did not allow open carry at the time, which included Florida, Texas, California, South Carolina, Illinois, New York, Oklahoma, Arkansas and the 42 states that did allow open carry.",
      "Gaetz then compared the total number of violent crimes (defined by federal officials as murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault) with the total population in the eight states without open carry in 2012. We checked his math and found the same result: Those states had a combined violent crime rate of about 434 per 100,000 people. The remaining 42 states had a violent crime rate of about 352 per 100,000. That means states with open carry laws did have a 23 percent lower violent crime rate that year.",
      "Not all open carry states are the same, however, and laws vary from state to state. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence lists states that prohibit the open carry of handguns in public places, states that allow open carrying without a permit, and states that require some form of license to open carry. They currently list five states that prohibit the open carrying of handguns in public places.",
      "But that's not the only issue with these statistics.",
      "We asked several experts about Gaetz's methodology. Many of them said the single law was too narrow to draw meaningful conclusions about its impact. In essence, his number -- for one year -- is right, but so what?",
      "Gaetz framed the use of the stats as \"evidence that this bill does not create a less safe environment.\" John Pierce, co-founder of gun rights group OpenCarry.org, agreed with that point. But he said the data doesn't necessarily reflect a correlation between allowing open carry and fewer instances of violent crime.",
      "He noted that Texas and Florida are both populous states with huge numbers of concealed carry permit holders so focusing just on open carry laws will give a skewed picture about the effect of legally-armed citizens on crime rates.",
      "Tomislav Kovandzic, a University of Texas professor who teaches classes on research methods and gun control, was more blunt.",
      "\"The problem with this approach is that it implicitly assumes that both groups of states were identical/similar before the laws in the treatment states (in this case, open carry states) were enacted,\" Kovandzic told PolitiFact via email. \"This is rarely, if ever, the case. As a result, the comparison merely reflects group differences that existed before the treatment states enacted the laws.\"",
      "A sound look at the issue would require controlling for factors like specific crimes, population characteristics or other details, not Gaetz's static group comparison.",
      "\"Even if he averaged multiple years together to make his open carry versus non-open carry comparison, it wouldn't change the futility of the approach,\" he said.",
      "What does more detailed research have to say? Florida State University criminology professor Gary Kleck said that plenty of research has found rates of carry permit holding \"have no net effect on crime rates, including violent crime rates, one way or the other.\"",
      "However, Kleck said that the research he has seen doesn't differentiate between open carry and concealed carrying.",
      "Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, pointed us to a 2010 study that looked at whether right-to-carry laws affected crime rates. The conclusion: they didn't.",
      "\"The best available evidence suggests that right to carry concealed laws are associated with increases in aggravated assaults with guns, but have no measurable effect on population rates of murder and robbery,\" Webster said.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Gaetz said, \"In the states that allow open carry, violent crime was 23 percent lower.\"",
      "This is a fact that experts say is largely meaningless and shouldn't weigh into any serious policy discussion.",
      "There may be less crime in those states, but there's no way the single data point Gaetz gave can provide clues as to the effects of open carry laws.",

      "So while the process is very thorough, Comey was saying he couldn't guarantee there would never be a problem and no terrorist could ever slip through the cracks. That's just the way it is.",
      "Comey noted that when the United States performed background checks on Iraqi refugees, they had a much larger database because of the American presence there over the last decade. Not having the same intelligence infrastructure in Syria has resulted in much less information with which to cross-reference an applicant.",
      "As Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson said during the same hearing that a refugee may have a criminal past that's unknown, or may suddenly commit a terrorist act after entering the United States.",
      "But even with the pitfalls of admitting refugees from war-torn regions, Comey said, the process works and has been improving over the years.",
      "\"The good news is we are much better doing it than eight years ago,\" Comey told U.S. Rep Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., later in the hearing. \"The bad news is, there is no risk-free process.\"",
      "Comey was echoing concerns he voiced to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Oct. 8.",
      "\"There is risk associated with bringing anybody in from the outside, but especially from a conflict zone like that,\" he told the Senate committee. \"From the intelligence community's perspective, as I said, I think we've developed an effective way to touch all of our databases and resources to figure out what we know about individuals. I don't think that's a cumbersome process. My concern there is that there are certain gaps.\"",
      "He repeated that sentiment to the House Judiciary Committee on Oct. 22.",
      "\"We have gotten much better as an intelligence community at joining our efforts and checking our databases in a way that gives us high confidence. If we have a record on somebody, it will surface. That's the good news,\" Comey said. \"The challenge we face with Syria is that we don't have that rich set of data. So even though we've gotten better at querying what we have, we certainly will have less overall. And so as I said to a question earlier, someone only alerts as a result of our searches if we have some record on them. That's the challenge we face with Syria.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Beruff said, \"The director of the FBI said that we cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East.\"",
      "Comey, while talking specifically about Syrian refugees and not all of the Middle East, has repeatedly said that admitting refugees has its challenges and that information gaps do exist. But he also has expressed confidence in the admission procedure and says it continues to improve. That makes it hard to argue Comey feels like the government's process \"cannot properly vet people.\"",

Illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay,\" states the ad. \"Collecting Social Security benefits, skipping the line. Our border open. It's more of the same, but worse. Donald Trump's America is secure. Terrorists and dangerous criminals: kept out. The border: secured. Our families: safe. Change that makes America safe again.\"",
      "The narration is accompanied by sinister music and footage of men being apprehended by border agents while other shadowy men walk freely on public streets.",
      "We have previously fact-checked Trump's claim that Clinton wants \"totally open borders\" and ruled that False. He is correct that she wants to allow more Syrian refugees in the United States.",
      "This fact-check will focus on whether Clinton supports allowing illegal immigrants convicted of crimes to stay in the country.",
      "There is some truth to his claim, but Trump's scary ad omits an important part of the story.",
      "Clinton's immigration plan: Deport violent criminals",
      "Clinton has not vowed to deport every undocumented immigrant convicted of a crime. But the ad creates a misleading impression that she will let every criminal stay, regardless of the crime.",
      "Clinton has repeatedly called for focusing deportations on violent criminals.",
      "Clinton campaign spokesman Joshua Schwerin pointed to Clinton's comments about her deportation priorities in a March debate in Miami, the National Immigrant Integration Conference and on her website.",
      "When pressed to explain her position during the debate, Clinton said she wants to limit deportations to \"violent criminals, terrorists, and anyone who threatens our safety.\"",
      "Clinton has proposed being more lenient than Obama:",
      "\"So I do not have the same policy as the current administration does. I think it's important that we move to our comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, stop the raids, stop the round-ups, stop the deporting of people who are living here doing their lives, doing their jobs, and that's my priority.\"",
      "She said violent criminals and those who plan terrorist attacks or threaten us are \"a relatively small universe.\"",
      "We asked for more details about the types of crimes that would be included on her deportation list and did not get a reply from the campaign.",
      "But it's fair to read into her statements that some criminals who committed lower-level crimes would be allowed to stay. That approach is similar to the current policy under the Obama administration. In 2014, a memo from the Homeland Security Department stated that the government would focus first on threats to national security, border security and public safety, including those involved or suspected of terrorism or felons. The second level of priority was for undocumented immigrants convicted of three or more misdemeanors (not including minor traffic offenses).",
      "That policy means that an estimated 87 percent of the undocumented population is not a priority for enforcement, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that examines immigration trends.",
      "\"We do not know enough details about Mrs. Clinton's plans to characterize who would get to stay or would be a priority for removal,\" said Michelle Mittelstadt, spokeswoman for the institute.",

      "\"Looking at Hillary's statements, it's clear that Trump's ad is misleading,\" he said. \"Many, but not all, unlawful immigrants committed criminal offenses, but they are usually not violent or property crimes. Instead those were crimes in the immigration statutes.\"",
      "The Trump campaign provided PolitiFact with information related to additional positions Clinton has taken that relate to undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes:",
      "2013 immigration bill: Clinton supported the immigration bill that passed the Senate but never reached a vote in the House. The bill said that undocumented immigrants could apply for Registered Provisional Immigrant (RPI) status, which allowed them to stay in the country if they met certain criteria including that they had not been convicted of a felony or three or more misdemeanors. This fits in with Clinton's plan to focus on violent criminals.",
      "Sanctuary cities: These policies generally refer to places where local law enforcement officers aren't required to alert federal authorities to residents who may be in the country illegally. During her first race for president, Clinton said she would not crack down on sanctuary cities and argued that without such policies, people will hide from police and not report crimes. But Clinton doesn't appear to want sanctuary cities to protect suspected murderers. In 2015, Clinton criticized the city of San Francisco for releasing a man from jail who later was charged with murdering a woman and had previously been deported many times. However, her campaign reiterated Clinton's view that she believes sanctuary cities can help further public safety.",
      "Trump's campaign also noted that thousands of undocumented immigrants who have been ordered removed and have criminal convictions remain in the country under Obama. We don't know how the pace of criminal removals would differ under Clinton if she were elected.",
      "But the fact that Clinton has criticized the Obama administration for deportation has raised concerns among those who want to see stricter enforcement.",

      "Our ruling",

      "Claiming that Clinton would create \"open borders\" suggests she would allow undocumented immigrants to travel freely or with very few restrictions between two countries.",
      "That's not what Clinton has proposed. Clinton supported legislation in 2013 that included a path to citizenship (with conditions) and heightened border security.",
      "However, some experts argue that \"open borders\" doesn't necessarily mean no enforcement at all, but rather making it far easier for undocumented immigrants to stay here. Clinton does want to make it easier for many undocumented immigrants, but that's not the same as getting rid of enforcement or allowing people to enter and leave the United States without border control.",

      "Clinton and Trump have taken vastly different approaches on immigration, although they have both said they favor secure borders.",
      "During this campaign, Clinton has called for addressing immigration laws including a path to citizenship within her first 100 days. But she has also called for protecting borders and deporting criminals or those who pose threats.",
      "\"We need to secure our borders. I'm for it, I voted for it, I believe in it, and we also need to deal with the families, the workers who are here, who have made contributions, and their children,\" she said in November. \"We can do more to secure our border, and we should do more to deal with the 11 or 12 million people who are here, get them out of the shadows.\"",
      "This is pretty consistent with her view as a New York senator and secretary of state.",
      "In her 2014 book Hard Choices, Clinton praised the 2013 immigration bill co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of senators including Marco Rubio of Florida. That bill included billions for border enforcement over a decade for new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as adding 20,000 border agents. That bill passed the Senate but never reached a vote in the House.",
      "Clinton's immigration platform does not amount to open borders, Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, previously told PolitiFact Florida when we fact-checked a similar claim by Trump that we rated False.",
      "Open borders existed before 1875, when there were no federal restrictions on emigrating to the country, he said. The United States had immigration restrictions from 1875 to 1924 without a border patrol, which was created in 1924.",
      "It's wrong to conflate \"open borders\" with anything less than perfect enforcement of immigration laws, he said. It's also wrong to \"claim Clinton is for open borders while she has also supported massive increases in border security to better enforce our restrictive immigration laws.\"",
      "But Clinton has said she wants to limit deportations to violent criminals, not deport children and end raids and round-ups and go further than President Barack Obama for DREAMers and their parents if legally possible although that is in legal limbo after the U.S. Supreme Court deadlocked. That greatly expands who could avoid deportation in a Clinton White House.",
      "Those policies amount to less enforcement to supporters of reduced immigration, including Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, and Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA.",
      "Beck has told PolitiFact that the term \"open borders\" is imprecise. However, if undocumented immigrants can \"stay as long as you don't commit a violent crime, that is pretty close to open borders. You don't have to give amnesty -- you can just not have a threat of deportation, and it allows people to stay.\"",
      "Our ruling",

      "\"No, absolutely not. We've never had a contract with Donald Trump,\" Murphy said.",

      "During the debate, Rubio was referring to two condo projects that Coastal Construction built: Trump Hollywood and Trump Royale in Sunny Isles Beach.",
      "According to Coastal Construction's website, it built Trump Royale, a 55-story, 386-residence project owned by Dezer Properties. Coastal won the contract for the project in 2005.",

      "(Although Patrick worked at Coastal Construction in the past, for much of the time that the condos were under construction, Patrick worked at Deloitte. Patrick Murphy owns between $1 million and $5 million in assets from Coastal Construction, according to congressional financial disclosure forms.)",
      "We interviewed Thomas P. Murphy Jr. as well as the owners of both projects, to find out the connection between Coastal Construction and Trump.",
      "There is no dispute that Coastal Construction was the builder, and Trump's organization had the licensing deal. But it was the owners -- The Related Group and Dezer Development -- who hired Coastal. The Related Group and Dezer reached an agreement with Trump separately.",
      "\"I hired Coastal to build the building, and I signed up with the Trump Organization for the licensing deal,\" said Gil Dezer, president of Dezer Development. \"The licensing deal was just that. It gave them no rights to construction decisions.\"",
      "(An article in The Real Deal, a real estate publication, in 2008 described a more intensive business relationship between Dezer and Trump and referred to Trump as Dezer's \"development partner.\")",

      "\"What that developer names that building, what they call it, has nothing to do with us,\"' he said. \"We've never had a single contract with Donald Trump.\"",
      "But clearly Coastal Construction at the time was aware of Trump's role and didn't appear to have a problem with it.",
      "CNN reported Oct. 25 that in a photo obtained from Getty, Thomas P. Murphy can be seen with Trump and a group of people wearing Trump-branded hard hats at the groundbreaking ceremony for Trump Hollywood in 2007. (Thomas P. Murphy is on the far left.)",
      "Murphy's campaign spokesman Joshua Karp said that Trump's involvement was irrelevant to Coastal's role building the units.",
      "\"Trump's name may have helped market the condo units after Coastal's role was completed, but Coastal has never benefited from Trump at all,\" he said. \"The developers paid Coastal for services, which was construction, and developers paid Donald Trump for the privilege of using his name and image in promotional materials. Point of fact, there was no money connection between Trump and Coastal Construction.\"",
      "So would we call the projects a \"partnership\" between Coastal Construction and Trump as Rubio said?",
      "We posed that question to Jack McCabe, a South Florida real estate expert hired as an expert witness on behalf of condo buyers in two separate Trump condo cases in Tampa and Fort Lauderdale.",
      "McCabe said that when condo buyers signed contracts, it included a paragraph that stated Trump was not a partner.",
      "\"Even though buyers had every inclination Trump was an actual partner in the deals, the paperwork said otherwise,\" he said.",

      "There is no technical term like \"pinprick\" when describing any kind of military intervention, Michael O'Hanlon, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and co-director of the institution's Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence, told us in a previous fact-check of this Rubio attack. O'Hanlon said that in his experience, when the word is used, \"it is always pejorative.\"",
      "Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said on Face the Nation on Sept. 1, 2013, that he wondered whether surgical strikes are \"just a pinprick that somehow Bashar Assad can trumpet that he defeated the United States of America.\"",

The notion that if we had provided some more modest arms to Syrian rebels that somehow that would have led to Assad's overthrow more decisively,\" Obama said. \"The notion that if I had taken a pinprick strike when the chemical-weapons issue came out, as opposed to negotiating and getting all those chemical weapons out that that would have been decisive. All those things I tend to be skeptical about.\"",
      "It's not clear if Obama is characterizing his own proposed strike as a \"pinprick,\" or describing a potential attack the way others may have suggested. Even so, it's still clear that back in 2013, he specifically avoided defining his proposal as any form of \"pinprick.\"",

      "In 2013, Obama did suggest a limited military response likely airstrikes from Navy ships after Assad's chemical weapons attacks on civilians. Obama only used the word \"pinprick\" to describe what he didn't want the attacks to be, and said repeatedly that the U.S. military isn't built for small-scale action. And while some officials have used the term, \"pinprick strikes\" aren't a true military description for any kind of operation.",

      "As early voters in Florida started casting votes, conservative websites buzzed about new evidence of crooked campaign tactics by Hillary Clinton to secure the crucial battleground state.",
      "The alleged scheme centered on left-leaning Broward County, already in the news for distributing some mail-in ballots without Amendment 2, a proposal to legalize medical marijuana.",
      "The claims originated from Roger Stone, a Donald Trump supporter and former campaign operative who talked of a \"secret\" meeting in an interview to conspiracy theorist and radio show host Alex Jones on Oct. 26.",
      "\"Yesterday Hillary Clinton shows up in Broward County slips into a private meeting with the woman who runs the board of elections,\" said Stone, who lives in Fort Lauderdale.",
      "It's common for election supervisors to meet with party officials if they have questions about election procedures. But a meeting directly with a presidential candidate would be unusual. Broward has about 600,000 Democratic voters the highest number in Florida so it is a key county for Clinton.",
      "Jones has millions of followers. The claim about Clinton secretly meeting with Brenda Snipes took off on social media, and some suggested that it was part of a voter fraud scheme.",
      "We found no evidence that such a meeting took place because it didn't.",
      "Within days, Stone retracted his claim. (A retraction doesn't allow a political figure to avoid the Truth-O-Meter, but we will explain what he initially said and then his latest explanation.)",
      "No meeting",
      "When we first heard the claim about a Snipes-Clinton meeting we were skeptical. Although Snipes is a Democrat, the former school administrator is not known for partisan or political involvement. In fact, a long list of politicians endorsed her opponent in the primary, although Snipes then won in a landslide. Snipes was first appointed to the position in 2003 by Republican Gov. Jeb Bush.",
      "In an Oct. 27 interview, Snipes told us she hadn't met with Clinton.",
      "\"She has not requested a meeting from me,\" Snipes said. \"I haven't met with anybody and neither has my staff. I don't even know who the members of her staff are. Neither I nor my staff met with Hillary Clinton.\"",
      "Snipes told the Sun Sentinel that it was a \"big fat lie\" that she met with Clinton. A spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign in Florida also denied that such a meeting took place.",
      "Stone said he would post photos of the Clinton-Snipes meeting on Jones' website Infowars \"shortly\" but never did.",
      "When we spoke to Stone on Oct. 28, he explained how he heard the allegation -- third-hand. He lacked even the most basic details, such as where this alleged meeting took place.",
      "He said information came from a coordinator for Citizens for Trump, a grassroots group. Stone said that the coordinator told him he spoke with two women from Citizens for Trump. The women said that they saw Clinton enter a meeting with Snipes.",
      "\"They claim they were inadvertently in a secured area of a presidential candidate visit,\" when they spotted Clinton enter a meeting with Snipes. \"Both admit they ran, they left the place in a hurry because they were shooed off by security.\"",
      "The women tried to take photos and video while they were dashing away, Stone said. The photos didn't show anything, and Stone said he is waiting for video.",
      "\"If Snipes denies it and there is no evidence to the contrary, I can say this is an incorrect report, but I'm not ready to conclude that yet,\" Stone said.",
      "After giving Stone a few more days to track down information, we circled back with him Oct. 31. That's when he retracted his story -- or rather moved his story to a different county.",
      "Stone told PolitiFact Florida that he went back on Jones' show Oct. 30 to say he was wrong about Snipes meeting with Clinton in Broward.",
      "\"I was incorrect about that,\" he said on the radio show. \"In fact, I was off by a county. The Clinton entourage pulled up behind the West Palm Beach office of the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections. Hillary Clinton was physically seen by at least three witnesses meeting with officials from the building. These observers were shooed away. ... Palm Beach is of course ground zero of the Democrats' vote stealing operation.\"",
      "(We sought contact information from Stone for these alleged witnesses but Stone said they were too scared to talk.)",
      "Again, the Clinton campaign said no meeting took place -- and Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher also said she didn't meet with Clinton.",
      "It is true that Clinton was in Broward and Palm Beach counties the week that Stone made these claims. She gave speeches at Broward College on Oct. 25 and Palm Beach State College on Oct. 26.",
      "During his interview with Jones, Stone tried to portray Snipes as incompetent and pointed to ballots missing the medical marijuana amendment. Stone said that Snipes announced that the amendment \"isn't going to be on the ballot in Broward County because of some kind of a screw up.\"",
      "That's an exaggeration. The amendment is on the ballot in Broward, but four absentee ballots so far have turned up missing the amendment.",
      "A group supporting marijuana legalization sued Snipes over the ballots omitting Amendment 2. On Oct. 28, a Broward judge ruled in Snipes favor and concluded that she had taken appropriate steps to remedy the errors including providing replacement ballots.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Stone said Clinton showed up in Broward County and slipped into a private meeting with elections supervisor Brenda Snipes.",
      "Stone was wrong. He heard it third-hand from Trump supporters who claim they stumbled across such a meeting. Snipes and a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign in Florida denied such a meeting took place and we found no evidence that it did.",
      "Days later, Stone admitted he was wrong but then claimed that Clinton met with elections officials in Palm Beach County. He lacks evidence for that claim, too -- and both the elections supervisor and the Clinton campaign deny it.",

      "His counterpart, Democrat Bill Nelson, has a 2.2 percent absentee rate since 2001, and 3.3 percent since Rubio took office in 2011.",
      "As Murphy's campaign said, the last senator from Florida to exceed Rubio's rate was George Smathers, a Democrat who had a 23.6 percent absentee rate over his 18 years in office.",
      "We'll note there was a significant uptick in missed votes during the end of Smathers' last term, from 1966 onward, which is 50 years ago. He missed 435 of 835 votes, or more than 52 percent, during his final four years. After that, Smathers declined to run for re-election and became a lobbyist.",
      "If we look at the sheer number of missed votes over a similar length of time, Paula Hawkins skipped 245 over six years, while Edward Gurney missed 293. Those are both more than Rubio's 234 missed votes. But remember, those two had significantly more votes to miss, so we think the absentee rates carry more weight.",
      "Other presidential candidates who were senators do miss plenty of votes. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who also ran for the 2016 Republican nomination, missed 139 of 321 votes between April 2015 and June 2016, an absentee rate of 43.3 percent. His career rate is 18.1 percent.",

      "But back to Floridians: A Rubio spokesman pointed out that Bob Graham, who ran for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, missed about the same number of votes during his campaign as Rubio did.",
      "That was a compelling bit of trivia to check. We found that between April 2015 and March 2016, the months Rubio was on the trail, he missed 157 of 242 votes, a 65 percent absentee rate. (Rubio's campaign clarified that he both declared and ended his campaign in the middle of those months, so his absentee rate then was 53.3 percent.)",
      "Graham missed 149 of 459 votes between January and November 2003, roughly the time he considered and campaigned for the presidency. That's an absentee rate of 32 percent. He underwent heart surgery on Jan. 31 that year, which caused him to miss votes before his official campaign launch on May 6. (Rubio's campaign noted that between May 6 and when Graham dropped out on Oct. 6, Graham's absentee rate was 50.4 percent.)",
      "That overall period also accounted for three-quarters of Graham's missed votes over 18 years in the Senate. Graham routinely spent months without missing a single roll call vote.",
      "Finally, overall voting trends in the U.S. Senate do change. Spessard Holland was a senator for 24 years between 1946 and 1971. GovTrack noted that in that time period, the average absentee rate for his peers was considerably higher 14.5 percent.",
      "Our ruling",

      "Rubio has the highest absentee rate since Smathers, who left office in 1969.

      "Opponents of Florida's medical marijuana amendment are warning that cannabis-enhanced edibles will endanger children, hoping that voters will eat up their dire predictions and reject the measure.",
      "\"Amendment 2 will bring kid-friendly pot candy to Florida,\" the anti-drug campaign Vote No On 2 said in a flier we received in the mail Sept. 22, 2016.",
      "The campaign is run by the Drug Free Florida Committee, an anti-drug group started in 2014 by longtime GOP fundraiser Mel Sembler and his wife, Betty, with financial backing from casino magnate Sheldon Adelson.",
      "We wanted to find out whether the medical marijuana amendment allows \"pot candy,\" and whether it really would be \"kid-friendly.\"",
      "Candy plan",
      "As a quick refresher, Amendment 2 would let doctors recommend medical marijuana for patients with a host of certain conditions, including cancer, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and more. It's only a recommendation, because marijuana still is illegal under federal law, so doctors can't prescribe it and pharmacists can't distribute it.",
      "The patients would take their recommendations to what is referred to as a Medical Marijuana Treatment Center, which would be regulated by the state to provide the drug. Here's where we get into Vote No On 2's assertion about pot candy.",
      "The amendment language says the following (emphasis ours):",
      "\" Medical Marijuana Treatment Center' (MMTC) means an entity that acquires, cultivates, possesses, processes (including development of related products such as food, tinctures, aerosols, oils, or ointments), transfers, transports, sells, distributes, dispenses, or administers marijuana, products containing marijuana, related supplies, or educational materials to qualifying patients or their caregivers and is registered by the Department.\"",
      "So while the amendment doesn't specifically mention candy, it does allow edibles. Proponents argue that edible forms of marijuana are better for some patients, in part because the effects can be longer-lasting than other methods of ingestion. That's also part of the problem, because it can be difficult to gauge how the drug may affect people when eaten instead of smoked.",
      "Vote No On 2 cites an uptick of children being hospitalized in many of those states for eating marijuana-laced candy, which they say is tempting to kids if left out. They pointed to several news stories about children in medical marijuana states consuming cookies, chocolate bars, brownies and other sweets and candies.",
      "In some of their cases it wasn't apparent if the candy was medical marijuana or from some other source. (It's also possible that people could always just buy cannabis in bud form and make their own edibles.)",
      "Ben Pollara, director of United for Care, the group behind the amendment, said Vote No On 2 was creating a \"total dystopian fantasy about the way the amendment could be implemented.\" He said a child getting into an adult's medical marijuana presents the same issues as any medication, and it was up to the adult to prevent accidents from happening.",
      "\"Put it away,\" he said. \"That's Parenting 101.\"",
      "Kate Bell, legislative counsel at the Marijuana Policy Project, which supports the amendment, said 19 of the 25 medical marijuana states allow edibles, although they all handle them a bit differently.",
      "Amendment 2 offers the state plenty of leeway on how it could regulate the marijuana industry. The Legislature would have to pass a law on the issue and the Department of Health would have to write the regulations. What those rules would specifically say is anyone's guess, and the health department told us that they couldn't speculate.",
      "A health department spokeswoman pointed out that under current Florida law allowing medical marijuana for some epileptics and terminal patients, the only prohibited form is smoking, which Amendment 2 would allow.",
      "That leaves us to look to see how other states handle guidelines about things like packaging and sales practices.",
      "Washington, for example, bans products designed to appeal to kids. Connecticut requires tamper-resistant packages just like prescription drugs. California, which is phasing in new regulations, requires labels warning patients to keep products away from children. New Jersey only allows edibles in lozenge form, which were previously only available to child patients to take at school. (There's an overview of guidelines for each state here.)",
      "In Colorado, which started selling medical marijuana in 2001 and recreational marijuana in 2012, there has been an increase in the number of children hospitalized for ingesting marijuana. A spokeswoman for the state's marijuana enforcement division acknowledged in 2014 that edible forms carry \"a significant public safety risk.\"",
      "Colorado this year banned some products shaped like people, fruit or animals. The state also requires opaque, tamper-resistant packaging and a label announcing the content of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. The state also is starting to use a universal symbol designating a marijuana product.",
      "That doesn't mean kids don't end up getting exposed to the drug. Mike Van Dyke, the chief of environmental epidemiology, occupational health and toxicology at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said the state continues to adapt its packaging policies to make edible marijuana less accessible to children.",
      "A Colorado report on the amount of emergency room visits and hospitalizations for marijuana exposure shows the number of affected children under 9 when use is more likely to be accidental has increased over the last 15 years. But Van Dyke says they still are small numbers. In 2000, prior to medical marijuana being legalized, only 1 child was hospitalized statewide. In 2014-15, there were 37 ER visits and 15 hospitalizations.",
      "There's also been an increase among people older than 9, too, but there are caveats to the data. Hospitals record these as exposures, but they don't necessarily specify how patients were exposed, or if they were at the hospital because of the exposure or for a related issue.",
      "\"We've definitely seen an increase, but a lot of people are inflating the impact of these cases,\" Van Dyke said. \"Prior to 2010, we didn't have commercially available, edible marijuana products, so of course there's going to be more instances with an increase in availability.\"",
      "The Journal of the American Medical Association this year published a study of marijuana exposures in Colorado for kids younger than 10. It found between 2009 and 2015, children's hospital visits increased from 1.2 to 2.3 per 100,000. The Washington Post noted that means hospitals and poison control centers are much more likely to get calls about diaper cream, toothpaste, laundry detergent and crayons than they are about marijuana.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Vote No On 2 said, \"Amendment 2 will bring kid-friendly pot candy to Florida.\"",
      "The proposal would allow edible forms of marijuana, but the amendment does not specifically identify candy. Calling it \"kid-friendly\" plays on parents' fears without any proof that's what will happen.",

      "On the day his name was announced, the Democratic senator from Colorado, Ken Salazar, didn't instantly commit to backing him but offered early praise: \"I have recently met with Mr. Gorsuch and believe he has impressive credentials.\"",
      "The Denver Post wrote that Gorsuch glided through a 20-minute Senate Judiciary Committee hearing June 21. Salazar and Colorado's Republican senator, Wayne Allard, \"introduced Gorsuch, both giving glowing reviews,\" the Post wrote.",
      "That committee approved Gorsuch by a voice vote on July 13.",
      "When Gorsuch moved on to the full Senate July 20, Salazar had more praise for the \"intelligent, thoughtful and appreciative\" nominee, saying Gorsuch met a \"very high test\" to join the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, opened his remarks in an earlier hearing by saying Gorsuch's record showed he \"appears to be a very conservative nominee.\"",
      "But before the Senate July 20, Leahy was on board with the nomination of Gorsuch and three other nominees: \"I am pleased that the Republican leadership has scheduled debate and consideration of these nominations and am glad that the Republican leadership is taking notice of the fact that we can cooperate on swift consideration and confirmation of nominations. Working together, we can confirm four judges today. \"",
      "A transcript of the July 20 Senate meeting shows no senator objected to Gorsuch and he was confirmed in a voice vote. (When the vote happened, one person is heard saying \"aye\" and no one objected.)",
      "McConnell's spokesman Don Stewart said that any member could have gone on record with an objection but none did.",
      "\"The Congressional Record lists no objections,\" he said. \"There was unanimous consent to the vote.\"",
      "Republicans have noted that Democrats in the Senate at the time include some major party heavyweights: Chuck Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Harry Reid.",
      "However, the majority of current senators were not in the Senate in 2006. And the stakes now are higher, says Sarah Binder, George Washington University political science professor.",
      "\"Senators may view the prospects of confirming a nominee to the court of appeals differently than they view a nominee for the Supreme Court,\" she said. \"The stakes of confirming someone to the Supreme Court are really just so much higher and more salient to the public. Senators should scrutinize any lifetime appointment to the bench -- but especially those to the Supreme Court.\"",
      "Many judicial nominees have sailed through confirmation by unanimous consent or in a unanimous roll call vote. But the process has become more acrimonious in recent years, and roll call votes became more common under the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama.",
      "Binder said that recorded roll call votes on appellate court nominees were very rare before 1997.",
      "\"Starting in late 1990s, Republicans in the Senate majority started to call for recorded votes as a way to put senators on record for or against Bill Clinton's judicial nominees,\" she said. \"Since then, recorded votes have been more likely (as have cloture votes on those nominees).\"",
      "Russell Wheeler, a judicial expert at the Brookings Institution, pulled together data on circuit court nominations during the presidencies of Clinton, Bush and Obama using the U.S. Senate website, the Federal Judicial Center's Biographical Directory of Federal Judges, Congress's \"Presidential Nominations\" website, and Congressional Record reports.",
      "During Bush's tenure when Gorsuch was confirmed, Wheeler's data shows 12 circuit court nominees confirmed through voice votes and 30 through roll call votes that were unanimous. There were three confirmation votes in which there was only one \"no\" vote and 14 in which there were multiple \"no\" votes.",

      "President Donald Trump told military commanders in Tampa that he will deliver new airplanes at a massive savings to taxpayers.",
      "\"We're going to be loading it up with beautiful new planes and beautiful new equipment,\" he said at U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base Feb. 6. \"You have been lacking a little equipment. We are going to load it up. You are going to get a lot of equipment. Believe me.\"",
      "Trump then gave himself credit for saving millions of tax dollars during his first two weeks in office: \"But we will ensure no taxpayer dollars are wasted. I have already saved more than $700 million when I got involved in the negotiation on the F-35. You know about that.\"",
      "The savings with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter are real, but they were in the works before Trump cried foul about the price tag. A Trump spokesman did not reply for this fact-check. (The Washington Post Fact Checker previously looked at a claim that Trump took credit for cutting $600 million and gave it Four Pinocchios.)",
      "Trump's transition tweets about the F-35 program",
      "The Defense Department is in the middle of the largest aircraft procurement ever for different versions of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. The F-35 is built by Lockheed Martin.",
      "Plans call for acquiring more than 2,400 aircraft over about 20 years at a cost of around $379 billion.",
      "Trump raised concerns about the F-35 program while campaigning.",
      "\"I'm hearing that our existing planes are better,\" he told radio show host Hugh Hewitt in October, 2015 questioning why the United States was spending \"billions and billions of dollars.\"",
      "He upped his criticism of the cost after he won the election.",
      "\"The F-35 program and cost is out of control,\" Trump tweeted Dec. 12. \"Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.\"",
      "Following Trump's tweet, Lockheed Martin's stock plummeted, and government officials defended the program.",
      "A week later, the F-35 Joint Program Office released the final price for the contract, which showed the airplanes for the Air Force and Marine Corps reduced by $5.9 million and $2.4 million respectively, while the Navy model saw an increase of $3.2 million.",
      "Air Force Lt. Gen Chris Bogdan told reporters that he anticipated that costs would \"come down in price significantly\" and put the savings \"somewhere on the order of 6 to 7 percent per airplane, per variant.\"",
      "The Washington Post calculated total savings between $549 million and $630 million for the full lot of 90 planes.",
      "During his transition into office, Trump convened top military brass, including Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson, at his estate at Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach on Dec. 21 to discuss how to bring costs down for the F-35 program. (Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg was also there. Boeing is the contractor for Air Force One, another project that Trump said was too expensive.)",
      "The next day, Trump tweeted: \"Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!\"",
      "A week before Trump's inauguration, Hewson said her company was close to a deal to significantly lower costs after the Mar-A-Lago meeting.",
      "Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a review of the F-35 program in late January. On Feb. 3, the Defense Department announced it had reached an agreement with Lockheed Martin for a $728 million reduction, leading to the \"lowest priced F-35s in program history.\"",
      "Lockheed Martin issued a statement praising Trump's involvement: \"President Trump's personal involvement in the F-35 program accelerated the negotiations and sharpened our focus on driving down the price.\"",
      "That, however, is not the end of the story.",
      "Costs predicted to drop for years",
      "Defense and budget experts offered a big caveat to Trump's claim: Costs had been coming down for years.",
      "Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said that the cost reduction for the Air Force variant of the F-35 had been in the works since before Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015.",
      "\"The savings are a little higher than was initially projected, but all President Trump did was elevate attention to the issue,\" Ellis said. \"He's not responsible for the savings, they were already in the pipeline long before he came on the scene.\"",
      "The cost per plane has always been a moving target, The Arizona Republic reported in 2014, and Lockheed Martin officials had said that costs had been coming down. The initial production model delivered in 2010 cost about $220 million, while the projection for 2020 ranged from $75 million-$85 million.",
      "The general manager of Lockheed's F-35 program, Lorraine Martin, said in 2015 that costs would drop further, \"allowing us to provide our warfighters a fifth-generation F-35 jet at a fourth-generation price by the end of the decade.\"",
      "The savings can be attributed to a normal learning curve, said Todd Harrison, a military budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "\"As you build more copies of an item you naturally get more efficient at the work,\" he said. \"That is a big part of what we are seeing here, and that would have occurred regardless of who won the presidential election.\"",
      "However, Harrison said that Trump can take credit for the fact that the government was able to negotiate a deal with Lockheed so quickly for the next batch of airplanes.",
      "\"For the previous lot of F-35s, DOD negotiated with Lockheed for about a year and a half and never reached a deal,\" he said. \"DOD ultimately used a somewhat unusual method for finalizing the contract unilaterally in late 2016.\"",
      "Ben Friedman, a military budget expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that the savings have nothing to do with Trump since they were already in the works.",
      "\"First, there are no savings yet, as they are anticipated, perhaps hopefully,\" he said. \"Second, it is normal for costs to fall as production goes forward and problems are solved. Third, it's not as if no one before Trump was looking to cut F-35 costs. It has been a fixation in the Pentagon for a long time.\"",

      "In the wake of mass shootings at the Pulse night club in Orlando and at the Fort Lauderdale airport, Florida lawmakers are expected to act on a series of bills to expand where people can carry their guns.",
      "The bills would allow concealed-carry permit holders to carry their guns in places such as airports, schools, college campuses, police stations and polling places. Florida leads the nation in conceal-carry permits with more than 1.7 million permits.",
      "Republican House Speaker Richard Corcoran supports expanding the list of where permit holders can carry their guns, possibly as a way to avert future attacks. (So does President Donald Trump, who promised to get rid of gun-free zones in schools and military bases.)",
      "\"Most of these mass shootings take place in arenas where you're not allowed to have a concealed weapons permit,\" he told CBS4 Miami's Jim DeFede on Feb. 12. (By \"arenas\" Corcoran seemed to be referring to places in general, not sports arenas.)",
      "Corcoran argued that people who commit mass shootings say they chose certain areas because they \"knew nobody had guns.\" That raises an interesting question, but it's separate from the focus of this fact-check: whether most mass shootings happen in places where concealed carry permits don't apply, or \"gun-free zones.\"",
      "Corcoran was citing research from a pro-gun advocate who reached that conclusion. But anti-gun advocates have argued that the data isn't so clear cut; they see other patterns in the statistical evidence. Overall, the evidence remains murky and depends on how researchers define \"gun-free\" or \"mass shooting.\"",
      "Varying definitions of mass shootings",
      "Corcoran's spokesman said he was referring to the numbers of mass public shootings compiled by economist John Lott, president of the pro-gun Crime Prevention Research Center.",
      "Lott's research has been quoted by those who support expanding gun rights, but academics often attack his research as flawed. His book More Guns, Less Crime has been a subject of ongoing academic and policy debates as well numerous fact-checks.",
      "His book argues that crime data over multiple years shows reductions in crime in states that have \"right to carry\" laws. But many other academics have said his work doesn't account for other factors that influence crime rates, and that he manipulates the data to reach his conclusions. The National Academies of Sciences concluded in 2005 that \"no link between right-to-carry laws and changes in crime is apparent in the raw data.\"",
      "Before we delve into the numbers compiled by Lott, we will explain why it's complicated to make sweeping claims of mass shootings in gun-free zones.",
      "There is not an agreed-upon definition of what constitutes a mass shooting -- even the federal government has cited various criteria at times.",
      "FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer pointed to a 2012 law setting the threshold for a \"mass killing\" as three or more people killed, but another report by the federal Congressional Research Service says that \"mass murder\" has been defined generally as a threshold of four or more deaths. Lott points to the types of shootings the FBI included in this study of active shooter situations, but that study clearly says it isn't covering all mass shootings.",
      "Lott said he included mass shootings in which four or more were killed that occurred in public, and he excluded those that occurred within the commission of another crime such as an armed robbery.",
      "Lott's data showed that between 1988 and 2015, about 3.8 percent of mass shootings occurred in areas where guns were allowed.",
      "Everytown for Gun Safety found that among 133 mass shootings between January 2009 and July 2015, 70 percent took place in private homes while 13 percent took place in \"gun-free zones,\" where carrying of concealed guns were prohibited. Another 17 percent took place in public areas where the carrying of firearms are allowed.",
      "Daniel Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, who has disagreed with Lott's findings, pointed to research by Louis Klarevas, a professor at the University of Massachusetts-Boston.",
      "In Klarevas' book Rampage Nation, he said that Lott has used too loose a concept of gun-free zones.",
      "Klarevas disagrees with gun advocates who define a \"gun-free zone\" as simply an area that bans private citizens from carrying a gun.",
      "For example, Lott characterized Fort Hood and Washington Navy Yard, military sites attacked by gunmen, as gun-free despite the presence of armed security.",
      "\"There's an obvious logical problem with such a conceptualization: How can a place be a gun-free zone if guns are present?\" Klarevas writes. \"The implication is that rampage shooters are only deterred by armed civilians, not by armed guards and cops. But that's an absurd suggestion.\"",
      "Klarevas uses three definitions: he refers to \"gun-free zones\" as places where civilians are not allowed to carry guns, and there aren't armed personnel stationed on the property. He calls \"gun-restricting zones\" as places where civilians can't carry guns, yet armed security is routinely present -- such as military facilities or certain college campuses. He refers to places that allow civilians to carry guns as \"gun-allowing zones.\"",
      "Using these categories, Klarevas examined 111 shootings since 1966 in which six or more people had been killed in each incident -- regardless of whether it occurred in a public or private location or if it was in the commission of another crime.",
      "He found 13 took place in gun-free zones and five took place in gun-restricting zones. That means that the majority occurred in areas where there was no evidence that private guns were prohibited.",
      "Since Klarevas includes mass shootings in private residences or during the commission of another crime, that means that he counts several additional incidents that aren't factored in by Lott.",
      "For example, as a mass shooting in a \"gun-allowing zone,\" Klarevas counts a gunfight between two rival biker gangs in Waco,Texas, in 2015 that left nine people dead. So that's an example of a shooting that wasn't in a gun-free zone that is omitted from Lott's calculations.",
      "The two also disagree on how to characterize whether guns were allowed at certain locations. Lott says that the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon was in a gun-free zone and points to a school policy that bans possession of firearms \"except as expressly authorized by law or college regulations.\"",
      "Umpqua Community College spokeswoman Anne Marie Levis previously told PolitiFact Florida the school's gun-free policy didn't apply to students with a valid permit. \"UCC was never designated as a gun-free zone' by any signage or policy,\" she said. \"Umpqua Community College does comply with state law by allowing students with concealed carry licenses to bring firearms on campus.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Corcoran said, \"Most of these mass shootings take place in arenas where you're not allowed to have a concealed weapons permit.\"",
      "Corcoran cites research by an advocate for gun rights who used a strict definition to define places where guns were not allowed. In reality, there are places where concealed weapons are permitted, places where police or security officers openly carry weapons, and places where concealed weapons are not permitted. Additionally, there are different ways to define mass shootings.",
      "We found that advocates for more gun control analyzed the data and reached different conclusions.",
      "Our assessment is that it is difficult to draw broad conclusions about the motivations of the perpetrators of mass shootings or whether they are influenced by gun restrictions. We rate Corcoran's statement Half True.",

      "President Donald Trump's executive order banning entry of people from seven countries prompted a wave of protests from immigration activists and Democrats in South Florida.",
      "U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Cuban-American Republican whose district includes parts of Miami-Dade, defended Trump's ban by comparing it with an action President Barack Obama took on Cuban refugees in his final days in office.",
      "\"I am struck by the double standard and hypocrisy of those who are offended by this executive order, but who failed to challenge President Obama when he took similar action against Cuban refugees; especially since President Obama's action was meant to appease the Castro regime and not for national security reasons,\" Diaz-Balart wrote in a statement to the press Jan. 30.",
      "Obama's rule change was about the \"wet foot dry foot policy,\" which Diaz-Balart criticized at the time as a \"concession to the Castro regime.\"",
      "Was Diaz-Balart accurate when he said Trump's action was similar to Obama's?",
      "In a word, no. Trump's order, which singled out immigrants from seven countries and refugees from everywhere, was far more broad than Obama's administrative rule change to put Cubans on more equal footing with arrivals from other countries.",
      "Trump's order and Obama's rule change",
      "Trump's Jan. 27 order states: \"I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order.\"",
      "Administration officials said that the order applied to people from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen -- countries identified by the Obama administration as terrorist hotbeds.",
      "\"In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles,\" Trump's order stated.",
      "Trump also put processing of all refugees -- which would include Cubans -- on hold for three months and suspended the vetting of Syrian refugees indefinitely, \"until such time as I have determined that sufficient changes have been made to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest.\"",
      "Obama's rule change, which came through a Department of Homeland Security regulation, applied to one group of people: Cubans. Obama's Jan. 12 announcement ended the so-called \"wet foot-dry foot\" policy that had allowed Cubans without visas who reached U.S. shores (typically Florida) to gain automatic entry to the United States to ask for political asylum.",
      "Under the policy, those caught at sea, however, were sent back to Cuba. The policy was started in 1995 under President Bill Clinton in an effort to end the rafter crisis and had a major impact in shaping immigrant-rich Miami-Dade County. Obama also eliminated the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program that allowed doctors to apply for parole at a U.S. embassy or consulate.",
      "The \"wet foot-dry foot\" policy, along with the Cuban Adjustment Act -- which remains on the books -- permitted those who reached dry land in the United States to get permanent residency and green cards after living in the U.S. for a year and a day.",
      "\"With this change, we will continue to welcome Cubans as we welcome immigrants from other nations, consistent with our laws,\" Obama said. The rule change, announced in the final days of his presidency, followed his announcement in 2014 to normalize relations with Cuba.",
      "Obama's rule change did not cut off immigration from Cuba. A Department of Homeland Security official told the Miami Herald that an immigration lottery allowed at least 20,000 Cubans to emigrate to the United States legally each year would remain in effect. Also a program that allows legal residents in the United States to apply for Cuban relatives to join them was expected to continue.",
      "We interviewed several experts on immigration who said Diaz-Balart's comparison was misleading because of the different scope of the directives. While Obama eliminated special treatment for Cubans, Trump's order singled out specific nationalities of immigrants for additional restrictions.",
      "\"President Obama decided that applying the same generally applicable standards for all nationalities should apply to Cuban noncitizens,\" said University of California Davis School of Law immigration law professor Kevin Johnson. \"In contrast, President Trump singled out citizens of seven nations for special treatment more harsh than that generally applicable to all other noncitizens.\"",
      "University of Miami immigration law professor Kunal Parker also said that Diaz-Balart's comparison is invalid.",
      "\"President Trump's order singles out certain countries for special treatment and specifically bans Syrian refugees from entering the United States,\" he said. \"Nationals of the seven targeted countries are henceforth going to be treated differently from immigrants and nonimmigrants from all other countries.\"",
      "Ted Henken, a Latin American studies professor at Baruch College, said that Trump's order reintroduces preferential treatment since it established a loophole for religious minorities.",
      "Trump's order states that when refugee admissions resume, that the federal government will \"prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.\" (The order doesn't specifically identify religions but the clause about religious minorities has been interpreted to refer to Christians who are minorities in Muslim countries.)",
      "Obama's rule change was about how to process people arriving from one country -- Cuba -- and wasn't related to vetting them for security threats. Trump's order specifically states that it is an order \"protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States.\"",
      "Diaz-Balart's spokeswoman Katrina Valdes told PolitiFact Florida in an email that the point of his statement was not to compare Trump's order and Obama's rule change \"but to highlight the hypocrisy\" of those who disagreed with Trump's order but supported Obama's rule change.",
      "\"President Obama, without warning, introduced chaos into the system for Cuban refugees,\" he said in a statement to PolitiFact Florida. \"Where was the outrage as they were waiting at the border, having traveled for miles in horrible conditions, to have the door slammed in their faces? Obama ended the special parole for the Cuban Adjustment Act and eradicated the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program. He didn't just more strongly vet them, and he didn't put on the brakes for the programs for three months. He ended them.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Diaz-Balart said that Obama \"took similar action against Cuban refugees\" as Trump did in his executive order.",
      "Experts said that Diaz-Balart is comparing two very different actions. Obama's rule change ended \"wet foot-dry foot\" -- a policy that provided special treatment to Cubans who arrived on U.S. shores without a visa. Obama didn't entirely halt immigration for Cubans; his rule change meant that they had to apply just like people from other countries.",

      "Republicans are attempting to link U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party that has pushed for single-payer health care.",
      "A Facebook ad by the National Republican Senatorial Committee ties Nelson, D-Fla., to U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.",
      "\"Elizabeth Warren doesn't think Obamacare goes far enough,\" states the Facebook ad, which started July 5. Then it quotes Warren saying \"the next step is single payer.\" The text on the screen continues: \"Does Sen. Nelson agree? He has in the past ... Sen. Nelson votes with Warren 90 percent of the time. Tell Sen. Nelson no to government health care!\"",
      "Republicans are targeting Nelson because he faces re-election in 2018 in a state won by President Donald Trump and he is likely to face Republican Gov. Rick Scott, a key advocate of repealing the Affordable Care Act.",
      "In June, Warren told the Wall Street Journal that Democrats should run on single payer in 2018.",
      "It's possible to view the ad and get the impression that Nelson has supported single payer, a system in which government would provide health care coverage for everyone similar to Canada.",
      "A spokeswoman for the NRSC disagreed with that interpretation. She said that the line is a reference to Nelson agreeing with Warren on a majority of votes. The NRSC's press release announcing the ad raises the question if Nelson will \"support Warren's socialized health care plan.\"",
      "\"It's a fair question, seeing Warren is advocating for Democrats up in 2018 to run on single payer,\" Katie Martin, NRSC spokeswoman, told PolitiFact.",
      "We'll examine the ad's entire text and issue an overall rating.",
      "Nelson has scarcely mentioned \"single payer\" at all in the years leading up to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, or even since that time.",
      "At an October 2005 speech to the Tiger Bay Club of St. Petersburg, the Tampa Tribune paraphrased Nelson's answer to a question about health care. The Tribune wrote that Nelson said he opposed a universal, single-payer health care program, but that employers should not be the main source of health insurance for individuals. Large groups of consumers organized into purchasing units should replace employers as group insurance purchasers, he said.",
      "Some Democrats pushed for a single-payer system leading up to the passage of the Affordable Care Act. (There was a time when Barack Obama supported it, too.) But there wasn't enough support for that route.",
      "In the summer of 2009, Nelson said little about the pending legislation, drawing heat from some Democratic activists. By the fall, he sounded cautiously supportive and called the bill a \"starting point.\"",
      "Nelson actually pushed back against those who said the health proposal would end up turning into single payer.",
      "For example, during a Senate Committee on Finance markup of the bill on Sept. 29, 2009, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, argued that \"the government plan will eventually lead us to a de facto single-payer system of health care.\"",
      "Nelson disagreed with Grassley's conclusion. \"Now you just made a statement that it will lead to a single payer. How in the world do you make that leap?\" Nelson said.",
      "Nelson's office declined to comment for this fact-check; however, on the day the NRSC ad appeared, Nelson addressed the question of his view on single payer while meeting with college students in Orlando.",
      "\"When people say, Are you for single payer,' I'm having enough trouble right now just keeping the ACA,\" Nelson said. \"America is not ready for single payer, but America is ready and has the ACA. People are trying to take that away and take health care away from 22 million people.\"",
      "Nelson has said he would not vote for the Republican's Senate health care plan and has called for bipartisan fixes. The legislation has failed to garner sufficient Republican support to proceed.",
      "The NRSC sent us a screengrab of CQ data showing a comparison of Warren's voting record with Nelson's record between January 2013 and June 27, 2017. The data shows that Nelson and Warren voted the same way on 1,126 votes out of 1,250, or 90 percent.",
      "The fact that members of the same party agree with each other on issues that reach a vote isn't a surprise in an increasingly partisan atmosphere.",
      "However, the issues that reach a vote don't tell the full story about a senator's beliefs, University of Miami political science professor Gregory Koger said.",
      "\"The Senate votes on a carefully selected sort of issues, biased toward extremely conservative ideas (to mollify Ted Cruz types), consensus proposals, or middle-of-the-road Democratic proposals,\" Koger said. \"Indeed, one of the reasons the Senate has been dysfunctional is that both parties fight hard to keep many issues from coming to a roll call vote.\"",
      "Voting together on a carefully screened set of issues does not imply agreement on controversial proposals.",
      "The NRSC said, \"Elizabeth Warren doesn't think Obamacare goes far enough: 'The next step is single payer.' Does Sen. Nelson agree? He has in the past ... Sen. Nelson votes with Warren 90 percent of the time.\"",
      "The ad suggests that Nelson supports Warren on most things, including a single-payer health care system. Actually, Nelson has said he doesn't support single payer and wants to focus on preserving current law. His voting record is similar to Warren's, but members of the same party increasingly vote alike due to a lack of bipartisan votes in the Senate.",
      "We rate this claim Mostly False."

      "President Donald Trump's unfounded allegations that millions voted illegally in 2016 is back in the news, with his supporters pointing to a new analysis that claims millions of undocumented immigrants voted in 2008.",
      "Fox and Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt talked about it on the morning show recently.",
      "\"5.7 million -- that's how many illegal immigrants might have voted\" in 2008, she said. Her comments referenced an article in the Washington Times, a conservative newspaper.",
      "Trump has made repeated claims about massive voter fraud and election rigging, which we've debunked again and again and again and again and again and again and again (and we debunked a claim by his spokesman Sean Spicer).",
      "The claim made on Fox and Friends is based on an extrapolation of a controversial study that relied on a very small number of responses. Researchers involved in the underlying survey of voters have cautioned against using their data to reach conclusions about noncitizen voters.",
      "We emailed a spokeswoman for Fox News and did not get a reply; however, the Washington Times article showed that the information came from Just Facts, a think tank that describes itself as conservative/libertarian and was founded by James D. Agresti, a mechanical engineer in New Jersey.",
      "Agresti's conclusions are based on data from a paper by Old Dominion University researchers who used data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, or CCES. He multiplied the findings in that data with U.S. Census Bureau estimates of the noncitizen population to come up with a conclusion about the number of noncitizen voters nationwide.",
      "It's important to note that the CCES researchers have disputed the conclusions Old Dominion researchers reached about noncitizen voters.",
      "Here's how the studies unfolded: In 2008, the CCES surveyed 32,800 adults nationwide online about their political views. Respondents answered at least 100 questions before they made it to the citizenship question, one of the last questions asked.",
      "The survey showed that 339 identified themselves as noncitizens -- about 1 percent of the total respondents. Then of the 339 self-identified noncitizens, 39 of those claim to have voted, said Brian Schaffner, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, one of the main researchers.",
      "That's 39 respondents out of 32,800 people who are now being used to extrapolate millions of illegal voters. Schaffner has warned that with a subset that small, the responses might be unreliable.",
      "\"Survey respondents occasionally select the wrong response by accident perhaps because they are rushing through and not reading the questions carefully, because they do not fully understand the terminology being used, or because they simply click on the wrong box on the page,\" Schaffner wrote in a Politico magazine article after the November election.",
      "Subsequent CCES surveys provide more evidence that some respondents answered the question wrong. There were 20 respondents who identified themselves as citizens in 2010 but then in 2012 changed their answers to indicate that they were noncitizens, which Schaffer said is \"highly unrealistic.\"",
      "In 2014, researchers at Old Dominion University used the CCES data in 2008 and 2010, as well as voter records in 2008, to conclude that more than 14 percent of noncitizens indicated that they were registered to vote. Their best guess at the portion of noncitizens who voted was about 6.4 percent, or 1.2 million votes cast.",
      "The researchers at CCES (including Schaffner; Stephen Ansolabehere, a Harvard political scientist; and Samantha Luks, managing director of scientific research at YouGov) have criticized the methodology used by Old Dominion.",
      "They said it didn't fully consider the possibility that people responded to the survey inaccurately.",
      "\"You are ignoring the measurement error in a very small group which is going to inflate those numbers,\" Schaffner said, \"then you assume this is a random sample of all noncitizens in the country, which it probably isn't.\"",
      "More than 100 political scientists from universities and colleges wrote an open letter in January disputing the Old Dominion paper as evidence for Trump's claim that millions of noncitizens voted.",
      "\"In a survey as large as the CCES, even a small rate of response error (where people incorrectly mark the wrong item on a survey) can lead to incorrect conclusions,\" they wrote. \"The scholarly political science community has generally rejected the findings in the Richman et al. study and we believe it should not be cited or used in any debate over fraudulent voting.\"",
      "Jesse Richman, one of the Old Dominion researchers and a political science professor, told PolitiFact he still stands by his research and responded to the criticisms by CCES researchers in a working paper in February.",
      "Agresti of Just Facts, the source of the numbers cited on Fox and Friends, used the same data from CCES and Old Dominion and concluded that between 594,000 to 5.7 million noncitizens voted illegally in the 2008 election. Agresti said his number on the high end of his range was higher than Old Dominion because he used different methodology in his calculations.",
      "Setting aside surveys, another way to find noncitizen voters is to examine state voter records and compare that with data about immigration status. But states have struggled with attempts to do that. Florida tried before the 2012 election and scrapped the effort amid many errors.",
      "We interviewed other election experts: Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine; Lorraine Minnite, political science professor at Rutgers University; and Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who has tracked voter fraud allegations since 2000.",
      "All three rejected Agresti's conclusions.",
      "There have been some instances of noncitizens voting, but actual evidence has shown small numbers among millions of votes cast nationwide. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who co-chairs Trump's voter fraud commission, has obtained a total of one conviction for noncitizen voting since 2015.",
      "North Carolina's 2016 post-election audit showed a few dozen noncitizen voters out of 4.8 million votes cast. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted announced in February that since he took office in 2011, he has identified 126 noncitizens who cast ballots.",
      "Fox and Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt said, \"5.7 million -- that's how many illegal immigrants might have voted\" in 2008.",
      "The number comes from a conclusion by Just Facts, a conservative/libertarian think tank. Just Facts' numbers came from a study by Old Dominion University researchers. That study was based on a survey which showed that 39 people out 32,800 claimed to be noncitizens who had voted. Just Facts used data from the study and Census estimates on the noncitizen population to come up with a national figure of noncitizen voters.",

      "As Florida House members took up a bill that would increase penalties for certain violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, participants noted a fundamental but often overlooked issue in the overall immigration debate: If you are in the United States illegally, does your mere presence in this country mean that you have committed a crime?",
      "It first came up in comments by Ingrid M. Delgado, associate for social concerns for the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops. She had come to the Florida House Judiciary Subcommittee on Criminal Justice on March 15, 2017, to testify against HB 83, a bill sponsored by Rep. Dane Eagle, R-Cape Coral, that would heighten the penalties for certain violent offenses -- including sexual battery, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, murder, and the use of a destructive device such as a bomb -- if the defendant was in the country illegally.",
      "Delgado said, \"Unlawful presence is not a crime. It is a civil violation.\"",
      "A few minutes later, Rep. Jennifer Sullivan, R-Mount Dora, spoke in favor of the bill, saying she wanted to remind her colleagues about the legal status of the people the law targets.",
      "\"It amazes me, honestly, that we've even been talking about this as long as we have,\" she said. \"I feel like in the midst of this, something has gotten lost that is a crucial, main point. And that is the fact that we're talking about people who are here illegally. That means that, legally, they are breaking the law.\"",
      "The bill ultimately advanced through the subcommittee on a party-line vote, with Democrats voting against it.",
      "But we wanted to get to the bottom of whether undocumented immigrants were committing a crime by just being in the country.",
      "According to legal experts, the answer is that most of the time, unlawful presence is not a crime.",
      "When we checked with the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops, Michele M. Taylor, the group's associate director for communications, pointed to the 2012 Supreme Court case Arizona vs. United States. The majority opinion found that \"as a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the United States.\"",
      "Experts agreed. Unlawful presence is neither a felony nor a misdemeanor, said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. It is a civil infraction that results in removal and a bar on re-entry for a certain period of time.",
      "\"Not everything that's illegal meaning against the law or violating the law is a crime,\" Shapiro said. \"There are civil violations, like when you get a parking ticket. Unlawful presence' is one of these. You don't go to jail or receive any other criminal punishment for being in the country illegally you get deported.\"",
      "Gabriel (Jack) Chin, a professor and director of clinical legal education at the University of California-Davis law school, echoed this analysis.",
      "\"It is not a crime to be present in the United States without authorization, such as by overstaying a visa,\" Chin said. \"But such a person is subject to being deported.\"",
      "That said, it's also important to distinguish between \"unlawful presence\" and \"unlawful entry,\" said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. Improper entry by an alien is indeed a misdemeanor, Roosevelt said.",
      "This distinction can make the use of these terms tricky.",
      "For instance, an undocumented immigrant who entered the United States improperly would have committed a crime. However, once that person is here, the simple act of being in the United States unlawfully is not by itself a crime.",
      "\"It is a crime to cross the border other than as designated by immigration officials, but there is no separate crime for being unlawfully present in the United States,\" Chin said.",
      "Another example of illegal entry would be if an individual is found in the United States after previously having been deported.",
      "\"Unlawful re-entry after a deportation order can be a federal crime, depending on circumstances,\" Taylor said.",
      "Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that generally opposes loosening immigration laws, said that while illegal presence is not a crime, it's easy for such individuals to run into separate criminal problems even beyond their method of entry, such as filling out an employment eligibility form to get a job when they aren't eligible to work.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Delgado of the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops said, \"Unlawful presence (in the United States) is not a crime.\"",
      "It is generally accurate that the simple act of being in the United States illegally is not, by itself, a crime. Rather, it's a civil violation that puts the individual at risk for deportation, but not for criminal prosecution. However, it's worth noting that someone who is unlawfully present might still have committed a related crime by entering the United States after having been deported, for instance, or entering in an illegal manner.",

      "The amendment permits insurers to set premiums based on the \"health status\" of an individual by looking at their current and past health status and make predictions about how much an individual will use medical care in the future, said Linda Blumberg, senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute.",
      "That's where pre-existing conditions could come into play, because it would mean that the costs rise for consumers who are sicker, said Timothy Jost, Washington and Lee University School of Law emeritus professor.",
      "\"Health status underwriting is literally charging a higher (possibly much, unaffordably, higher) premium to people with pre-existing conditions,\" Jost said. \"Under the MacArthur amendment, they could not be refused coverage, but insurers could impose high enough premiums that coverage would be unaffordable.\"",
      "The amendment says that the waiver would allow states to set up a high-risk pool or participate in a new federal invisible risk-sharing program to help states reimburse insurers for covering high-risk consumers.",
      "\"No state may obtain a waiver for health status unless it has taken these efforts to protect those who might be affected,\" stated a MacArthur press release. \"In states with a waiver, individuals who maintain continuous coverage could not be rated based on health status.\"",
      "That means people who stay insured without any lapses can't be charged more by insurance companies if they get sick.",
      "But experts said that many low-income people aren't able to stay covered without breaks, and that questions remain about the effectiveness of the high-risk pools.",
      "The American Medical Association, which opposes the amendment, said in a statement that it \"could make coverage unaffordable for people with pre-existing conditions.\" The AMA raised questions about whether the high-risk pool would be \"sufficient to provide for affordable health insurance or prevent discrimination against individuals with certain high-cost medical conditions.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said of the GOP health care amendment, \"Pre-existing conditions are in the bill.\"",
      "The amendment says that health insurers can't limit access to coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, but that insurers can charge people more if states agree. In some states, health insurers would be able to charge sicker people more. And experts warn that high-risk pools -- the mechanisms meant to keep premiums lower for sick people -- might not be effective.",

      "\"We have got 20 million folks out there across this land who have told the federal government, Phooey, nonsense, I'm not going to participate in your program because it doesn't do what I need done,\" he said. \"So, they are paying a penalty. They're paying the IRS a fine or a penalty because the federal government is dictating to them what they don't want to do, or they are saying, give me a waiver.\"",
      "Price's characterization leaves out a lot. Many of the 20 million are likely uninsured not as a personal preference, but because they still can't find coverage.",
      "Penalty under the Affordable Care Act",
      "The Affordable Care Act includes an individual mandate to urge people to obtain health care coverage.",
      "The mandate that began in 2014 penalizes individuals for each month they lack health insurance that meets the minimum essential coverage. The penalty is assessed on tax returns and increases every year a person remains uninsured. The fee is whichever is higher: 2.5 percent of household income or $695 per adult or $347.50 per child.",
      "The mandate has many exemptions depending on income, membership in groups like Indian tribes, and incarceration. If individuals don't fall into those categories, the health insurance marketplace lays out 14 categories that exempt people from the financial penalty if they cannot afford it, such as being homeless or filing for bankruptcy.",
      "The American Health Care Act passed by the House May 4 gets rid of the individual mandate, one of the least popular provisions of the law.",
      "In January, the Internal Revenue Service reported that in 2016 about 80 percent of taxpayers -- 117 million -- indicated on tax forms that they had qualifying coverage all year while about 12.7 million taxpayers claimed one or more exemptions. The most common exemption was for people who earned below a certain threshold in a state that didn't expand Medicaid.",
      "Additionally, the IRS reported that 6.5 million taxpayers were paying a fine instead of getting insurance. Add that to the people who claimed exemptions from the penalty, and that totals 19.2 million, close to Price's 20 million.",
      "Still, that means just over 60 percent of the 20 million who aren't insured are claiming exemptions.",
      "Steven Ullmann, director of the University of Miami's Department of Health Sector Management and Policy, said millions of people struggle to find coverage because they aren't eligible for Medicaid due to states not expanding Medicaid. There are also those who don't qualify for the federal subsidy to purchase insurance through the exchanges.",
      "\"They are uninsured because there is no way that they can afford the insurance,\" he said. \"Then there are others, generally the young invincibles,' who find that the penalty of $695 is less than the cost of the insurance policies (generally over $2,000 a year),\" he said. \"They'd rather go bare and take their chances.\"",
      "The penalty hasn't had its intended effect of driving people to sign up for health care, said Joseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts.",
      "\"To be effective, the penalty almost certainly needs to be bigger,\" he said. \"And for a lot of obvious political reasons, that sort of tougher penalty is not in the cards now, nor was it plausible when the ACA was drafted. A weak penalty was the original sin of Obamacare.\"",
      "Price's office didn't respond to our queries. His claim is similar to a statement by President Donald Trump at a Feb. 27 meeting with health insurance company executives.",
      "\"It's gotten so bad that nearly 20 million Americans have chosen to pay the penalty or received an exemption rather than buy insurance,\" Trump said. (That claim was debunked by fact-checkers including the Washington Post and CNN.)",
      "On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order that gave federal agencies broad authority to defer or delay any part of the Affordable Care Act that costs anybody any money, including the penalty. The IRS said in February that it was reviewing Trump's order \"but that legislative provisions of the ACA law are still in force until changed by the Congress, and taxpayers remain required to follow the law and pay what they may owe .\"",

      "Price mentioned the number of people who are either paying a fine because they don't have insurance or who are claiming an exemption, usually because they don't qualify for affordable coverage. About 6.5 million taxpayers reported the penalty in 2016 tax filings, and 12.7 million taxpayers claimed one or more exemptions, bringing the total to about 20 million.",

      "The Daily Kos list, however, doesn't include Democrat Phil Murphy's win over Republican Kim Guadagno in the general election to succeed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.",
      "The New Jersey governor's race brings the initial total to 37 Democratic gains.",
      "We found a slightly lower total from Geoffrey Skelley, the associate editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Skelley found that Democrats have gained 33 seats on net in special elections for state and federal legislature and elections in New Jersey and Virginia.",
      "Unlike the Daily Kos, Skelley's net total reflects that Republicans took three seats away from Democrats in special elections and one seat away in New Jersey.",
      "From here, we tried to find examples of municipal races where Democrats won seats from Republicans not an easy task. There is no database of smaller municipal elections nationwide. Further, municipal elections are often nonpartisan races, so candidates aren't officially latched to one party or the other.",
      "With those limitations, we searched news stories. An article by the Huffington Post about \"historic victories\" by Democrats on Nov. 7, 2017, includes two clear-cut examples of Democratic mayoral candidates beating Republican incumbents, including the Manchester, N.H., mayor's race that Lewandowski mentioned in his speech.",
      "Adding those races to the highest number of state-level wins brings our verified total to at least 39 flipped seats for Democrats.",

It does.\"",

      "Simmons' statement misses several historical facts.",
      "By the time Hitler took power in 1933, Germany had been operating under the 1928 Law on Firearms and Ammunition. The measure relaxed strict controls imposed after World War I that banned all gun ownership, and created a system to register and sell firearms.",

      "At the same time, the German state confiscated weapons from Jews, Communists, Social Democrats and unions that refused to affiliate with the Nazi Party. Did the 1928 registration law make this easier?",
      "Perhaps, but Ellerbock's research showed many holes in the system. For the most part, it recorded only new sales, while many people had unregistered weapons dating from World War I.",

      "\"In my records, I found many Jews who well into the late 1930s possessed guns,\" Ellerbock told us.",
      "So registration was spotty, confiscation was selective and Nazi allies found it easier, not harder to get weapons.",
      "Much later, in 1938, the Nazis passed a new law that liberalized gun ownership in many respects, while simultaneously banning ownership and manufacture by Jews.",
      "Simmons brought up June 30, 1934, when Hitler \"sent out his secret police and murdered all of his political opponents.\" That was the night of Operation Hummingbird, Hitler's crackdown on a very specific group the Sturmabteilung that he had nurtured and encouraged to intimidate any group that stood in his way.",
      "The paramilitary group's leader Ernst R hm was eager to consolidate his power, and that set him on a collision course with established leaders in the German military and Hitler's top advisers. They persuaded Hitler that R hm was planning a coup.",
      "Over a span of several days, R hm and scores of Sturmabteilung leaders were arrested and executed. The Nazis killed at least 85 people, most but not all associated with R hm.",
      "Specific to Simmons' remark, the incident had more to do with internecine fighting among the Nazi community than with going after disarmed citizens. Quite the opposite, the Nazi leaders knew full well that they were going up against a group that had plenty of weapons.",
      "At one tense moment, a truckload of armed brownshirts drove up to the hotel where R hm was being arrested. According to Hitler's chauffeur, Hitler himself walked up to the unit's leader and told him to \"drive back to Munich immediately!' The man complied.",
      "Simmons said that Hitler \"took all the weapons\" and had a registry of everyone and then, on the night of June 30, 1934, murdered his political opponents. This oversimplifies and mangles the historic facts.",
      "While Hitler did take weapons away from Jews, Communists and Social Democrats, he also armed private citizens to better terrorize those same political opponents. To reduce Nazi gun policy to confiscation of weapons is to miss at least half the story.",
      "According to a German historian who has gone through the records, Hitler \"drastically increased\" the number of privately held weapons. On the confiscation side, she noted that the registry was limited and far from comprehensive.",
      "Contrary to what Simmons said, Hitler didn't take everyone's weapons and the registry at the time was so incomplete that many Jews retained their weapons.",
      "Furthermore, Simmons miscasts the connection between Hitler's gun policies and the events of June 30, 1934. Far from targeting disarmed leaders, it was a strike at the well-armed pro-Nazi Sturmabteilung.",
      "Hitler's real desire to disarm his opponents doesn't overcome the flaws in this statement.",
      "We rate this claim False.",
      "Update (March 7): Simmons responds",
      "After we published we heard from Simmons. He told us that when he made his remarks, he was referring to the people Hitler subjugated and killed, primarily the Jews.",
      "\"I do not believe I am in error,\" Simmons said. \"All Jews were denied the ability to have weapons. They had registries of everyone who was Jewish. And they killed 6 million.\"",
      "Simmons said that on the Senate floor, \"you only have so much time and you have to condense things.\"",
      "Videotape of Simmons' remarks shows no mention of the Jews. The claim we checked is complete and omits no context."

      "In Georgia's closely watched congressional special election, the surprisingly strong Democratic candidate, Jon Ossoff, has touted his policy experience in national security -- and taken heat for allegedly embellishing it.",
      "Ossoff is running to succeed Republican Tom Price in the U.S. House, after Price's confirmation as secretary of Health and Human Services under President Donald Trump.",
      "Historically, Price's affluent, suburban Atlanta district has been solidly Republican. However, Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the district by only 1.5 percentage points in 2016 -- well below the usual Republican performance -- giving Democrats hope that Ossoff could win the April 18 special election.",
      "Polls show Ossoff leading the multi-party field, with Republican candidates splitting the rest of the vote. If he can get to 50 percent, Ossoff could win the seat outright without having to compete in a runoff. That possibility has prompted Democrats from across the country to flood his war chest with donations.",
      "The question of Ossoff's national security background first came up in the news release announcing his campaign on Jan. 5. \"A Georgia native who grew up in the Sixth District, Ossoff served Georgia as a national security staffer in Congress for five years before leaving government for the private sector,\" the release reads.",
      "Ossoff, 30, continued to emphasize his experience on the campaign trail, such as in a campaign appearance and on this podcast.",
      "However, opponents raised questions about his experience, noting that Ossoff had worked on Capitol Hill between 2007 and 2012 but had only earned his undergraduate degree from Georgetown University in 2009. That would make him a pretty junior staffer to be touting his national security experience.",
      "We decided to take a closer look.",
      "The timeline",
      "After the criticism emerged, Ossoff's campaign released a timeline of his years on Capitol Hill. Here it is:",
      "January 2007: Starts working for Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., as a part-time legislative correspondent, working 25-30 hours a week while attending Georgetown's School of Foreign Service.",
      "May 2009: Graduates from Georgetown's School of Foreign Service.",
      "Summer 2009: Spends the summer traveling before he returns to work as a legislative assistant for Johnson in August 2009.",
      "January 2010: Promoted to senior legislative assistant.",
      "April-July 2010: Runs Johnson's re-election campaign.",
      "September 2010: Returns to Johnson's Capitol Hill office.",
      "March 2012: Receives a top-secret security clearance and staffs Johnson for all work related to the annual National Defense Authorization Act.",
      "Mid August 2012: Leaves Johnson's office.",
      "This timeline, which appears to match the congressional staff records we were able to find, confirms that Ossoff did indeed work as a congressional staffer for five years.",
      "Why this raises legitimate questions",
      "However, it's important to keep in mind some important context about Ossoff's first two years on Johnson's staff. During those two years, Ossoff was working with the office only on a part-time basis and hadn't received his undergraduate degree yet.",
      "Moreover, his title -- legislative correspondent -- is not exactly a lofty one. Here's how the Congressional Management Foundation describes it: \"Researches and writes legislative correspondence; conducts legislative research; assists legislative assistants as needed.\"",
      "In other words, the primary job of a legislative correspondent is to answer mail from the lawmaker's constituents and to backfill for more senior office staffers when necessary.",
      "In 2009, one of the years Ossoff held the position, the median salary for a legislative correspondent was $38,875, more than the $37,504 for a staff assistant and well below the next rung up on the ladder -- legislative assistant at $50,500, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "And what do staff assistants do? According to the Congressional Management Foundation, a staff assistant \"handles word processing, filing, faxing; responds to general constituent requests; processes tour and flag requests; staffs the front reception area, greets visitors and answers telephones.\"",

      "Ossoff's former supervisors, however, maintain that Ossoff had substantially more responsibility than a typical legislative correspondent.",

      "\"Putting just any college student in that situation would be malpractice, but honestly, Jon was not a typical college student,\" Satcher said. \"He handled the issues, so we felt very comfortable\" with the unusual arrangement.",
      "Satcher said that he himself had some experience on national security issues from his previous work on Capitol Hill, so he was able to backstop Ossoff when needed.",
      "Johnson, the congressman, backed up Satcher's description.",
      "\"I had no military assets in my district and was not a military guy,\" Johnson told PolitiFact, \"Jon's level of information on the issue was much deeper than mine at that time. While he was a legislative correspondent, he was learning how to be a legislative assistant.\"",
      "Johnson's office added that Ossoff played a key role in the House's June 18, 2007, passage of H.Con.Res.80, a non-binding resolution about the civil war in northern Uganda. That occurred just a few months after Ossoff joined the office.",
      "Johnson said that Ossoff also handled some more mundane duties in the office, such as some information technology assignments. Still, he added, \"to say that Jon staffed me on national security, that's entirely, 100 percent correct.\"",
      "Is this version of events credible?",
      "Of course, in addition to being Democrats, both Johnson and Satcher have an incentive to see their former staffer win a seat in Congress. So we tried to determine independently whether the scenario they describe is plausible.",
      "We reached out to half a dozen staffers who we determined had worked for House co-sponsors of the Uganda resolution, but we did not hear back from anyone who was able to comment either way.",
      "We did, however, run everything we had learned past the staff at LegiStorm, a company founded by Jock Friedly, a former investigative and congressional reporter. The company, which is nonpartisan, collects and analyzes data about Congress. They are perhaps best known for collecting publicly available salary information about Capitol Hill staffers.",
      "Friedly and a researcher on his staff, Keturah Hetrick, pored over the available information for PolitiFact and concluded that there was nothing to contradict Ossoff's version of events. They said that \"it's not a stretch\" for Ossoff to have handled substantive foreign-policy issues despite his low-level position.",
      "\"Legislative correspondents are rarely going to be the primary staffer handling a given legislative issue, but they will also handle some policy work,\" Hetrick said.",
      "What Johnson and Satcher said \"sounds totally plausible,\" she said. At the same time, she added, official documentation is silent on whether Ossoff was officially Johnson's primary foreign affairs staffer between 2007 and 2009.",
      "Norman Ornstein, a longtime Congress-watcher at the American Enterprise Institute, said Ossoff's statement amounts to \"resume inflation,\" though, in his opinion, a \"rather benign\" example.",
      "\"Legislative correspondent is a junior staff position, but it at least requires that the staffer know enough about his boss's policy positions that he can write letters, both to constituents and executive agencies, that are accurate and in some cases nuanced,\" he said.",
      "A better phrasing, Ornstein said, would have been that he spent \"five years as a staffer in the U.S. Congress, including work on national security.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Ossoff said, \"I've got five years of experience as a national security staffer in the U.S. Congress.\"",
      "This description certainly applies to his final three years on Capitol Hill, which were spent in middle- to senior-level foreign policy posts. Whether it applies to his first two years working for the lawmaker is less clear cut.",
      "His former supervisors insist that due to unusual circumstances within the office, Ossoff handled foreign-policy duties above his pay grade during that time. An independent expert told us that the explanation is plausible.",
      "That said, Ossoff at the time was an undergraduate student holding a part-time position that, in the Capitol Hill pecking order, was entry-level. That adds relevant context, and he left it out.",

      "Agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue went to an elementary school lunchroom in Virginia to announce new rules for the food schools serve.",
      "Under the banner of trimming the childhood obesity rate, combatting rising levels of diabetes and other health problems, Congress passed and the Obama administration implemented new targets for schools. Perdue gave schools more time to comply in two areas -- whole grains and sodium levels -- and expanded the rules for milk.",
      "\"We're giving these food service professionals the flexibility to move as we get a healthier generation,\" Perdue said May 1. \"This is not reducing nutritional standards whatsoever. It's pausing here to evaluate whether or not the progressive standards of moving even further are appropriate or not.\"",
      "Perdue argued that if kids don't like what they're offered, they simply won't eat it, and giving schools more time to comply would help children get more of the nutrition they need.",
      "We focus here on Perdue's claim that his move does not reduce nutritional standards. Is it true that they do no reduce nutritional standards set by the department in 2012 \"whatsoever?\"",
      "While Perdue is technically correct about not reducing the standards, his department will not be enforcing them.",
      "\"He is not changing the standards per se, but he is allowing schools to not follow them,\" said nutrition policy researcher David Pelletier at Cornell University. \"It's a bit like saying the posted speed limits on the roads remain the same, but you can go as fast as you want.\"",
      "The starting point",
      "Washington's school lunch program reaches about 30 million kids every day at a yearly cost of about $11 billion. To qualify for federal support, schools must meet a number of dietary regulations.",
      "In 2012, the Agriculture Department announced the final version of Nutrition Standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs.",
      "For milk, schools could provide \"flavor in fat-free milk only.\"",
      "By 2015, all grain products, such as bread, oatmeal and noodles had to be \"whole grain-rich.\" That term meant that at least half was whole grain and the rest could be processed but enriched with vitamins and minerals.",
      "The rule for reducing sodium, or salt, was more complicated and set increasingly lower targets that varied slightly by age group.",
      "So for example, by July 2014, a lunch for an elementary student couldn't contain more than 1,230 mg of sodium, which is about 65 percent of the upper limit for a full day as set in the Federal Dietary Guidelines. By July 2017, the target became 50 percent of the daily limit, and by July 2022, the target went down to about 33 percent.",
      "Making 'school meals great again'",
      "Perdue's office sent out a press release entitled \"Ag Secretary Perdue Moves to Make School Meals Great Again.\" It said the department would start the process to allow schools to start serving 1 percent flavored milk. At the elementary school event, Perdue said, \"I wouldn't be as big as I am today without chocolate milk.\"",
      "For grains, schools could apply for exemptions to the whole grain-rich content rule through 2020.",
      "On sodium, any school meeting the first target for lunches of about 65 percent of the daily limit would be considered in compliance through 2020.",
      "In a statement, the department said this was similar to a 2016 memo from the Obama Agriculture Department. That memo said it recognized that manufacturers had lagged in cutting down the salt in food, and so schools \"that are working toward compliance\" would not suffer if they hadn't yet made the grade.",
      "Perdue's policy is more lenient, declaring that no school need push beyond the first target while, as Perdue said, the department pauses \"to evaluate whether or not the progressive standards of moving even further are appropriate or not.\"",
      "Were nutrition standards reduced?",
      "For whole grains and sodium, the new policy extends the timeline for achieving those standards, but so far, the overall goals remain -- with the option to reassess later.",
      "Pelletier of Cornell and nutrition policy researcher Joann Slavin at the University of Minnesota both said the underlying nutrition standards are unchanged.",
      "But Pelletier called Perdue's statement a \"semantic trick.\"",
      "The situation with milk is a little trickier. The 2012 rules, which match the recommendations from a 2009 National Academy of Sciences panel, said flavored milk had to be non-fat. Perdue hasn't officially changed that yet, but he said \"USDA will seek to publish an interim rule as soon as possible to effect the change in milk policy,\" to allow flavored 1 percent milk.",
      "Slavin said the federal rules on milk went too far. That said, they were published as nutritional standards and followed the guidance from an independent research group.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Perdue said his changes to the school lunch requirements did not reduce nutritional standards. The plain facts and the assessment of experts confirm that the long term goals for whole grains and sodium remain in place for now. However, under the new policy, schools need not make more progress toward those goals for another three years.",
      "In addition, the current standards don't allow flavored 1 percent milk, and the new policy states that the department wants to change that through an interim rule. So the standards might not have changed yet, but Perdue said he plans to do so.",

      "Moments after the House passed a bill to significantly overhaul the nation's health care system, Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., blasted an email to constituents. While the bill \"doesn't fix the entire problem,\" he said, it \"begins the process of fixing our broken health care system.\"",
      "A PolitiFact reader sent us a copy of Loudermilk's email and asked us to fact-check it. We zeroed in on one of the exchanges in a \"frequently asked questions\" section that sought to explain some of the bill's provisions:",
      "\"Why are you cutting women's health services?\"",
      "\"We're not. In fact, we're expanding women's access to health services by redirecting Planned Parenthood dollars to community health centers, which vastly outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics.\"",
      "Could pushing Planned Parenthood out of the picture really expand women's access to health care? We found that there are indeed more community health centers than Planned Parenthood clinics -- but that doesn't mean that redirecting dollars to them will amount to \"expanding women's access to health services.\"",
      "Some background",
      "The GOP health care bill bill would effectively block Planned Parenthood for a year from securing reimbursements from Medicaid -- not just for abortions, which is already the case, but for any services, from pap smears to birth control.",
      "Planned Parenthood says abortion services are already walled off from payments they get for services that have nothing to do with abortion. But abortion opponents have long argued that the government is tacitly supporting abortion even by reimbursing Planned Parenthood for non-abortion services, saying such money is fungible once it reaches Planned Parenthood's coffers.",
      "The bill's change could have a significant impact on Planned Parenthood: About 43 percent of the group's budget comes from the government, including grants and reimbursements, much of which comes from Medicaid. The group says the bill, if enacted, could lead to closures of clinics and leave women without access to vital services, especially in medically underserved areas.",
      "Do community health centers \"vastly outnumber\" Planned Parenthood clinics?",
      "Loudermilk has a point on the numbers of clinics.",
      "We looked at a census of clinics that provide contraceptive services published in April 2017 by the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health nonprofit. The group tallied up various types of clinics, the most numerous of which are \"federally qualified health centers\" -- defined by the federal government as \"safety-net providers that primarily provide services typically furnished in an outpatient clinic.\" Such facilities can include community health centers, migrant health centers, homeless health care centers, and public housing primary care centers.",
      "For 2015, the census tallied 5,829 federally qualified health centers nationally, compared to 676 Planned Parenthood clinics.",
      "That's a ratio of greater than 8-to-1, so the adjective \"vastly\" seems appropriate.",
      "Would the bill redirect money from Planned Parenthood to community health centers?",
      "Not necessarily.",
      "Planned Parenthood received about $553.7 million from the government in 2015 for its services; the group, however, does not make public what portion of that is specifically from the federal government because the funding streams from different levels of government are sometimes hard to disentangle. The best estimate we can get comes from the Congressional Budget Office, which projected that the provision blocking federal funding to Planned Parenthood would result in $178 million in reduced federal outlays.",
      "If the CBO's projection is accurate, then the increase in federal funding to community health centers in the bill -- $422 million -- would represent a larger federal investment than the money being held back from Planned Parenthood. At first glance, that would seem to make the bill a net expansion in dollars, if you consider only these two line items.",
      "However, a couple issues balance against the notion that that this will represent an expansion of care.",
      "First, there is no guarantee that the $422 million spent would go towards the same patients, and for the same services, that would be lost due to the Planned Parenthood cuts. The bill does not explicitly require that.",
      "Another caveat comes from a different conclusion in the same CBO analysis. \"To the extent that there would be reductions in access to care under the legislation, they would affect services that help women avert pregnancies,\" CBO wrote. \"The people most likely to experience reduced access to care would probably reside in areas without other health care clinics or medical practitioners who serve low-income populations. CBO projects that about 15 percent of those people would lose access to care.\"",
      "The immediate loss of care for 15 percent of Planned Parenthood patients also undercuts the argument that money would simply flow from one type of clinic to the other.",
      "Would redirecting funding to these centers expand women's access to health services?",
      "There's reason to be skeptical.",
      "For starters, common sense suggests that even if community health centers ended up being able to serve every single patient currently served by Planned Parenthood, that wouldn't qualify as \"expanding women's access to health services\" -- it would simply be maintaining it. The closure of as many as 676 Planned Parenthood facilities would require an awful lot of expansion of resources elsewhere just to keep pace, before any \"expansion\" of access begins.",
      "And there's reason to believe that community health centers may not be able to pick up the slack if Planned Parenthood centers disappear.",
      "First, there's a capacity problem. Planned Parenthood centers tend to be unusually efficient in providing health services to women, because that's their specialty. The average Planned Parenthood clinic served 2,950 patients for contraceptive services in 2015, compared to 320 for the average federally qualified health center, according to the Guttmacher census.",
      "\"Because by definition health centers are in medically underserved communities with elevated risk and insufficient primary care, the last thing one does is get rid of any supply,\" Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University, told PolitiFact. \"This is the corker. Health centers are overwhelmed with need.\"",
      "And currently, community health centers are already operating with a shortage of staff, making any rapid expansion that much trickier.",
      "\"Workforce challenges are one of the primary barriers to health center patient growth,\" the National Association of Community Health Centers concluded in a 2016 report on its sector. \"If all health center clinical vacancies were filled today, health centers could serve 2 million more patients.\"",
      "And second, community health centers and Planned Parenthood clinics aren't interchangeable, experts say.",
      "Guttmacher data indicates that Planned Parenthood centers \"are considerably more likely to offer a broad range of contraceptive methods than sites operated by other types of agencies. Nearly all Planned Parenthood health centers offer the full range of Food and Drug Administration-approved reversible contraceptive methods,\" compared to half of federally qualified health centers.",
      "Rebecca Kreitzer, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, recently told the Atlantic that oral contraceptives and condoms are cheap enough that community health clinics can afford to give them out and then request federal reimbursement, but IUDs and contraceptive implants -- two long-term but reversible methods -- are often too expensive for clinics to front without immediate payment.",
      "By contrast, Planned Parenthood is a big enough network that it can afford to provide more expensive methods immediately. Because of this, Planned Parenthood clinics are also likelier to have staff on hand with the requisite expertise.",
      "\"Just because there is a federally qualified health center near where there is a Planned Parenthood Clinic does not mean we can assume the women going to Planned Parenthood would easily be served,\" said Keith J. Mueller, head of the Department of Health Management and Policy at the University of Iowa.",
      "When the Atlantic investigated how prepared Iowa health clinics were to pick up patients from Planned Parenthood, they found that lists of clinics provided by Republican lawmakers included \"a dentist's office, a school nurse, and a youth shelter\" as well as one clinic that had closed and several that didn't provide family-planning services.",
      "\"They're assuming we're the alternative,\" Ted Boesen, CEO of the non-profit Iowa Primary Care Association, told the magazine. \"But we're waiting to see what kind of a scale it is.\"",
      "Finally, the Energy and Commerce Committee said it's possible to argue \"that Planned Parenthood provides inferior overall service because they cannot offer holistic care to their patients, as they are a boutique reproductive health provider.\"",
      "But experts say the committee's emphasis on full-spectrum health care is more expensive than reproductive health care",
      "\"Because health centers must think about the full spectrum of primary health care for all patients, the absence of a specialized safety-net provider such as Planned Parenthood would be deeply problematic,\" Rosenbaum has written. \"When health centers attempt to respond to a surge in demand, they must think about not just the specialized services lost, but all of the health needs of the patients who find their way to a health center, not to mention those of their families. As a result, the anticipated cost per patient served is far higher than family planning and related services alone.\"",
      "In other words, the higher cost of providing care at community health centers is another reason why the increased federal funding figure in the bill may not be sufficient for replacing the lost Planned Parenthood services.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Loudermilk said that in the House Republican health care bill, \"we're expanding women's access to health services by redirecting Planned Parenthood dollars to community health centers, which vastly outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics.\"",
      "Purely on the numbers, he has a point that there are more federally qualified health centers than Planned Parenthood clinics. But the notion that bypassing Planned Parenthood would mean \"expanding\" access is dubious. Challenges of geography, capacity, specialization and cost raise significant questions about whether existing centers, even if they were provided with Planned Parenthood's federal revenue stream, would be able to maintain the current patient load, much less expand it. We rate the statement Mostly False.",

      "The original full-tuition HOPE scholarship was renamed the Zell Miller scholarship in honor of the former U.S. senator and governor. It significantly racheted up the eligibility requirements.",
      "Aimed at high performers, the Zell Miller scholarship program was limited to students with a 3.7 grade point average and a combined score of at least 1200 for the critical reading and math sections on the SAT or a 26 ACT score.",
      "The original HOPE scholarship remained in name, but the bill made it less generous. Instead of full tuition, it provided support that approached 90 percent of tuition, and it no longer covered books and other costs.",
      "Unlike the Zell Miller award for elite scholars, the HOPE scholarship remained free of a standardized test score requirement. As before, students were eligible if they had at least a 3.0 grade point average.",
      "Did Abrams actually save the HOPE scholarship program from a standardized test requirement?",
      "Abrams' communications director Priyanka Mantha told us Abrams did.",
      "\"The original Republican proposal sought to impose testing requirements on students who wished to receive the scholarship, in order to narrow eligibility,\" Mantha said. \"But under her leadership, the scholarship retained an eligibility tier without testing requirements because such tests would have disproportionately disqualified low-income students and students of color.\"",
      "There is no hard data on the discussions that took place behind closed doors, but an Atlanta Journal Constitution article from that time said the test score idea was in play. The news report listed eight suggestions. One of them was \"require high school graduates to earn a minimum SAT/ACT score to be eligible.\"",
      "Mantha said the creation of the Zell Miller scholarship with a test score requirement was the result of Abrams' intervention.",
      "\"The two tiers of the HOPE program are the crux of the compromise she achieved,\" Mantha said. \"Students who may have been eliminated from eligibility under the GOP proposal instead retained access to a version of the HOPE scholarship.\"",
      "Ben George, chief of staff to the Senate Minority Leader in 2011, said his boss and other Democrats were not part of the discussions and were \"caught completely off-guard\" by the deal with the governor.",
      "As part of the 2011 bill, lawmakers raised the grade average for the HOPE grant for technical colleges from 2.0 to 3.0. According to a report from the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, a liberal-leaning study center, full-time enrollment in the state's technical college system fell \"nearly 25 percent between 2011 and 2012.\"",
      "In 2013, lawmakers rolled back the hike in the grade average.",
      "Other changes, however, remained in place, including pulling back the amount of HOPE grant and scholarship aid. That made it harder for lower income students to stay enrolled.",
      "After the first two years, a Wall Street Journal analysis found that students from higher income neighborhoods went from being twice as likely to secure a full-tuition scholarship to three times as likely, compared to students from lower income neighborhoods. Georgia State University told the Journal that it had to drop dozens of students for not paying tuition after their scholarship aid dropped (although most of them were able to return after the school made a special plea to donors).",
      "Abrams said she led the fight to prevent the use of standardized test scores as part of the HOPE program.",
      "In 2011, she supported a plan to make minimum test scores part of the eligibility requirements for the full-tuition HOPE scholarship. The bill that emerged renamed the full-tuition scholarship, raised the minimum grade point average and added a minimum test score requirement.",
      "The bill did not add similar requirements to the original scholarship program, but made it less generous.",

      "Georgia state Sen. Michael Williams received some on-air fact-checking from CNN when he criticized Delta Air Lines for ending a discount partnership with the National Rifle Association while favoring \"liberal-leaning organizations\" such as Planned Parenthood.",
      "Delta ended a discount agreement with the NRA in order to remain \"neutral\" in the national debate over gun control, which resurfaced after a Feb. 14 mass shooting in Florida.",
      "\"If they're going to pull the discount for NRA members, why not pull it for Planned Parenthood or some of the left organizations out there?\" Williams, R-Cumming, claimed during a Feb. 27 interview with CNN's Brianna Keilar.",
      "Keilar asked for his source of information to back up Delta discounts for Planned Parenthood. Williams said he and other state senators \"looked it up on Google.\"",
      "\"Just to be clear, no, we looked it up as well. And it doesn't appear, after some digging, that we have been able to determine that that is actually factual, because you're indicating something that may not be true there,\" Keilar responded.",
      "Williams, who's running to become Georgia's governor, said he \"very firmly\" believed that Delta \"is out there giving discounts to left-leaning organizations as well.\"",
      "\"But if you're making that argument,\" Keilar said, \"shouldn't you have your facts straight?\"",
      "Like CNN, PolitiFact Georgia found no evidence to support Williams' claim. Williams' campaign did not provide evidence to prove it, and Planned Parenthood told us there are no perks, discounts or deals that come with being a Planned Parenthood supporter or member whether with Delta or any other company.",
      "\"There are no corporate perks that come with being a Planned Parenthood supporter or member,\" said Erica Sackin, director of political communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action Fund.",
      "Delta did not respond to our query.",
      "Williams and Keilar's debate continued off-air on Twitter: Keilar asked for backup on the Planned Parenthood claim. Williams tweeted back that his team had responded. Keilar said his statement still did not back up his \"bogus claim.\" Williams ultimately tweeted a statement saying Keilar was pushing a \"false narrative.\"",
      "Williams' statement mentioned \"Delta's history of supporting left-wing organizations that donate to abortion provider Planned Parenthood.\"",
      "That's a few steps removed from what he said in the interview about Planned Parenthood receiving the discount itself.",
      "Williams started to backtrack from that in the Keilar interview. Here's a transcript of the original exchange on CNN:",
      "Williams: \"You're telling me that Delta is not giving away discounts to left-leaning organizations? Is that what you're telling me?\"",
      "Keilar: \"No, you told me that it was Planned Parenthood. I'm just talking to you about what you said to me.\"",
      "Williams: \"I know, but is that not a left-wing organization? ... It is a very left-leaning organization.\"",
      "Keilar: \"There's no indication they are giving discounts to that organization, is my point.\"",
      "Williams: \"Again, let's, I guess, agree to disagree, because, again, we cannot -- bring me back on and I will have the information for you about where they're giving away these discounts to (a) left-leaning organization that support(s) Planned Parenthood.\"",
      "So in addition to Williams saying Delta gives discounts to Planned Parenthood, he backs it up to say Delta has ties with left-leaning groups that in turn support Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions. That doesn't check out either.",
      "Williams' spin that Delta has ties to the Susan. G. Komen Foundation, which supports Planned Parenthood, is also wrong.",
      "\"A quick Google search reveals Planned Parenthood receives hundreds of thousands of dollars from Delta partner Susan G. Komen,\" Williams said in his printed statement. \"It's as simple as that. Has Delta cut their ties with the Susan G. Komen Foundation like they did the NRA?\"",
      "Andrea Rader, spokeswoman for the breast cancer research organization Susan G. Komen, told PolitiFact Georgia, \"Komen does not and has not had a partnership with Delta at either the state or national level.\"",
      "Komen does have seven grants in local markets to Planned Parenthood, totaling $277,000, for breast exam services, Rader said.",
      "Williams may have conflated Susan G. Komen with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, an actual Delta partner. The Breast Cancer Research Foundation told PolitiFact Georgia it does not give money to Planned Parenthood.",
      "Greg Bluestein, a political reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, tweeted to Williams that Komen said his claim about a Delta partnership is incorrect. Williams tweeted back, \"They may want to issue a new statement\" and included a link to a website for Flashpoint Agency, billed as a marketing agency.",
      "Flashpoint Agency' page has photos of a white and pink plane with a pink ribbon that appears to be Breast Cancer Research Foundation's logo. \"As part of Delta's work with the Susan G Komen Foundation Flashpoint was brought in to help launch the Pink Plane' for Breast Cancer Awareness,\" the website said, incorrectly identifying the partnership.",
      "We found a Reddit post where a user wrote \"Delta ends NRA discounts. Keeps relationship with Planned Parenthood.\" The user included a screenshot of a Twitter exchange asking Delta, \"Did you end your discount for Planned Parenthood?\"",
      "The Delta Twitter account responded, \"Hey Stuart. We don't handle this over Twitter however I will send you the link below where you could find further information. http://bit.ly/2CRW68T Have a fabulous day. *TLJ\"",
      "(Delta sent the user a broken link, which the user noted in a reply.)",
      "We asked Delta if it offered discounts to Planned Parenthood but the airline did not respond to that specific question.",
      "Delta shared a memo from CEO Ed Bastian to Delta employees regarding the company's NRA decision and subsequent action by Georgia lawmakers to remove a jet fuel tax exemption from a tax bill that could have saved Delta millions of dollars a year.",
      "\"While Delta's intent was to remain neutral, some elected officials in Georgia tied our decision to a pending jet fuel tax exemption, threatening to eliminate it unless we reversed course,\" Bastian said. \"Our decision was not made for economic gain and our values are not for sale. We are in the process of a review to end group discounts for any group of a politically divisive nature.\"",
      "Williams said Delta offers a discount to Planned Parenthood.",
      "We found no evidence that supports Williams' claim. Planned Parenthood said its donors and members do not receive any corporate perks from Delta, and Williams failed to show that one exists. Williams' campaign said that a Planned Parenthood supporter is a Delta partner, but that's also not true.",

      "Hillary Clinton colluded with big business to maintain slave wages for workers in one of the world's poorest countries, according to the host of an RT American comedy news show.",
      "Comedian and activist Lee Camp of RT's Redacted Tonight mocked Clinton's efforts to \"keep 37 cents per hour out of the hands of destitute Haitians.\"",
      "\"In 2009, while Bill Clinton was setting up one of the family's shell companies in New York, in that same year Hillary Clinton was at the State Department working with U.S. corporations to pressure Haiti not to raise the minimum wage to 61 cents an hour from 24 cents,\" Camp said April 17. \"Seriously.\"",
      "Seriously?",
      "Sort of. Memos from 2008 and 2009 obtained by Wikileaks strongly suggest, but don't prove without a doubt, that the State Department helped block the proposed minimum wage increase. The memos show that U.S. Embassy officials in Haiti clearly opposed the wage hike and met multiple times with factory owners who directly lobbied against it to the Haitian president.",
      "The Clinton campaign refuted the claim, and the State Department didn't comment.",
      "HOPE, not change",
      "In 2011, Wikileaks made nearly 2,000 cables available to the progressive magazine, The Nation, and Haiti Libert , a weekly newspaper in Port-au-Prince.",
      "The two media outlets assessed the cables and found, among many other revelations, that the \"U.S. Embassy in Haiti worked closely with factory owners contracted by Levi's, Hanes, and Fruit of the Loom to aggressively block a paltry minimum wage increase\" for workers in apparel factories.",
      "The Wikileaks cables show U.S. Embassy officials began monitoring the minimum wage issue as early as 2008, when the Haitian Parliament began discussing doubling or tripling the daily minimum wage of 70 Haitian gourdes to keep up with inflation. That's roughly equal to $1.75 a day, or about 22 cents per hour.",
      "(Some context here: Three quarters of Haitians live on less than $2 a day, according to the United Nations' World Food Program, while garments constitute about 90 percent of Haiti's exports, according to the Guardian. Haiti increased the daily minimum wage to the equivalent of $5.11 in 2014.)",
      "But back in 2008 and 2009, embassy officials repeatedly told Washington that a hike would hurt the economy and undermine U.S. trade preference legislation known as HOPE.",
      "The program, shorthand for the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2006, gives garments manufactured on the island duty free access to U.S. markets. Levi Strauss, Haneswear, Nautica, and Dockers are just some of the American companies that benefit from HOPE. Congress passed HOPE II in 2008, extending the program for another 10 years.",
      "In January 2008, Ambassador Janet Sanderson wrote that representatives of the business community including the man tasked with implementing HOPE had met with embassy officials and criticized Haitian President Ren Pr val's efforts to raise the minimum wage as the wrong medicine for the ailing economy.",
      "An unsigned embassy cable sent to Washington in December 2008 echoed the private sector's assessment and reported that increasing the minimum wage would \"have significant impact\" on business.",
      "The State Department continued to promote HOPE as an economic boon for the island. In memos prepping U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice and Clinton for their visits to Haiti, charg d'affaires Thomas Tighe told the diplomats to \"urge\" the Haitian government take advantage of HOPE and HOPE II.",
      "After advising a congressional delegation to Haiti almost exactly the same thing, Sanderson told Washington that Haitian Prime Minister Michele Pierre-Louis was onboard with HOPE, \"although pending legislation to nearly triple the minimum wage would likely set back those efforts in the short term.\"",
      "Deputy Chief of Mission David Lindwall put it most bluntly, when he said the minimum wage law \"did not take economic reality into account but that appealed to the unemployed and underpaid masses.\"",
      "Pr val as proxy",
      "Nonetheless, the Haitian Parliament voted to triple the daily minimum wage to 200 gourdes ($5 a day, or about 62 cents per hour) in May 2009. As the bill awaited President Pr val's signature, students protested over the delay while factory owners criticized the legislation.",
      "The U.S. Embassy, meanwhile, continued to lament the hike and raised concerns about the stability of the region that they hoped Pr val would help address, according to the cables. Pr val, as they say, leaned in.",
      "Sanderson, in a June 10 memo, cited a study by the Haitian Association of Industry (ADIH) stating that the new minimum wage \"would result in the loss of 10,000 workers in the sector\" and noted that ADIH has met with Pr val three times.",
      "\"A more visible and active engagement by Pr val may be critical to resolving the issue of the minimum wage and its protest spin-off' or risk the political environment spiraling out of control,\" she wrote.",
      "A few days later, Pr val seemed to be on board with the embassy and industry position on the minimum wage issue.",
      "On June 17, Tighe told Washington that industry and USAID studies found that a 200 gourdes minimum wage \"would make the sector economically unviable and consequently force factories to shut down.\"",
      "He also noted that ADIH members and HOPE factory owners told U.S. officials that in lieu of greenlighting the legislation as is, Pr val would instead propose a lower, phased-in minimum wage for the textiles sector (100 gourdes in 2009, 125 gourdes in 2010, and 150 gourdes in 2011).",
      "Protesters continued to call for Pr val to sign the original bill, with some demonstrations escalating into violence, as parliament considered the president's amendments.",
      "In a June 24 cable to a congressional delegation, Tighe said the demonstrations added uncertainty to the political and security situation in Haiti and \"job creation under HOPE II may be threatened by a bill Parliament passed May 5 to nearly triple the minimum wage.\"",
      "When the delegation met with Pr val the next day, the president parroted this line and encouraged the congressmen \"to write to Haitian members of Parliament to express concern about the devastating impact a sector-wide increase in wages would have on job security and job creation,\" according to a memo from Tighe.",
      "By July, Pr val was a formal and vocal opponent of the 200 gourds wage, warning of the consequences for jobs and emphasizing the importance of the assembly sector for exports, according to cables.",
      "\"This is the only issue in recent memory where the president has made a strong effort, by negotiating with stakeholders and using the media, to effect a legislative outcome,\" Tighe said.",
      "In the fall of 2009, Pr val and Parliament agreed to enact the $5 daily wage for all sectors except textiles, which got a $3 wage. But was the State Department right in opposing the increase?",
      "\"I have no idea what would happen if Haiti did have a $5-a-day minimum wage,\" Adam Davidson of NPR's Planet Money said in 2011. \"But I do think it's reasonable to assume that some factories would close and far fewer new ones would be built. Far fewer Haitians would be allowed to take that first tentative step on to the ladder of industrial development.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Camp said, \"In 2009 ... Hillary Clinton was at the State Dept working with U.S. corporations to pressure Haiti not to raise the minimum wage to 61 cents an hour from 24 cents.\"",
      "Leaked cables show that the U.S. Embassy in Haiti opposed the minimum wage hike that the Haitian parliament passed in 2009, and discussed the issue with business groups.",
      "However, the cables do not contain conclusive evidence that the State Department actively pressured Haiti to block the increase nor do they prove that Clinton personally played a role.",

      "The post on an anti-vaccination website was damning.",
      "The headline \"Bill Gates uses 30,000 Indian girls as guinea pigs to test cancer vaccine,\" appeared on the Organic & Healthy blog in October and is still being shared. The article described a 2009 human papillomavirus vaccination demonstration project in India. In the span of about a year, thousands of girls between the ages of 10 and 14 received one of two vaccines to prevent genital warts that are linked to cancer later in life.",
      "According to the blog, the project went terribly wrong.",
      "In one Indian state, \"some of the girls' health deteriorated and five of them died the next year,\" the article said. In a second state, \"two deaths were reported.\"",
      "One of our readers saw the blog post and asked us to check it out.",
      "We did and as with many false claims, it takes a thread of fact and weaves a blanket of misinformation. We specifically looked at whether the vaccinations led to any deaths.",
      "First, a little background on human papillomavirus, or HPV.",
      "HPV causes genital warts and cervical precancers that can lead to a variety of cancers. In the United States for example, HPV is responsible for over 30,000 cancers each year. Several vaccines to prevent the warts and precancers came on the market in 2006. Since then, about 200 million doses have been administered worldwide. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for the most common virus strains, the vaccines \"provide close to 100 percent protection against cervical precancers and genital warts.\"",
      "So, what happened in India?",
      "In 2007, the Indian government's Council of Medical Research and two state governments laid the groundwork for a project to see whether these vaccines could be delivered cost-effectively in lower income communities. An international nonprofit PATH was directly responsible for the work. The vaccinations began in 2009 and by March 2010, they had vaccinated about 24,000 girls between the ages of 10 and 14. The effort was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and in addition to India, it took place in Peru, Uganda and Vietnam.",
      "The trouble began when local newspapers reported several deaths linked to the vaccinations. In October 2009, a coalition of community organizations and health activists called for a halt to the project. Their cries grew more insistent. In an April 2007 letter to the Minister of Health, in addition to the deaths, they said over 120 girls had suffered everything from mood swings to epileptic seizures. The government agreed to stop.",
      "No deaths",
      "The government commissioned a group of physicians and researchers to investigate whether the vaccination program caused any deaths. In February 2011, the group reported there was no connection. One girl drowned. Insecticide poisoning killed two others. Two others had severe malaria. One was bitten by a poisonous snake and one died from a disease that physicians said \"can not be linked possibly to HPV.\"",
      "No reputable study has ever tied the vaccine to a death.",
      "The vaccines can have side effects, including fever, headache, fainting and nausea. But according to many studies cited by the CDC, these pass quickly.",
      "Not guinea pigs",
      "The article paints a picture of global pharmaceutical companies experimenting on unsuspecting young, poor girls. In fact, the vaccines have gone through years of testing and have become commonplace in the wealthiest nations. Australia provides it to every girl and boy between 12 and 13 years old in public school. Vaccinations are routine in France, Germany and Holland. The vaccines are on the market in over 100 countries and the World Health Organization recommends it as part of the national immunization program for any nation that can afford it.",
      "A problem of process",
      "A 2010 article in the British medical journal Lancet assessed what went wrong in India. Its basic conclusion? Officials were too slow to respond when local concerns first emerged.",
      "\"Reluctance by public health authorities to respond to issues of public distrust for fear that they will exacerbate the problem is dangerous,\" the authors wrote.",
      "The repercussions lasted for some time. In 2013, an Indian parliamentary panel chastised PATH, the international nonprofit, along with its Indian partners for failing to fully inform the parents of the girls of what they were doing and not having a system in place to track any side effects.",
      "Our ruling",
      "An anti-vaccination blog tied Bill Gates to the deaths of several girls who were part of an HPV vaccination roll out in India. A full medical investigation determined that the girls died from causes completely unrelated to the vaccine. Some were poisoned by insecticide, malaria took others, and one drowned.",
      "Many millions of young girls and boys have received the vaccine over the years and while there are some common side effects, they are mild.",

      "Secretary of State John Kerry aired an old complaint about the public and foreign aid. In a speech before the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Kerry bemoaned a persistent misconception about how much money Washington sends overseas.",
      "\"Do you know that amazing surveys show that many of our citizens think we devote a full quarter or even a third of our federal budget to foreign aid?\" Kerry said on Oct. 26, 2016.",
      "Foreign aid covers both military aid and more humanitarian forms of assistance such as fighting disease and boosting economic growth in other countries.",
      "Kerry's comment accurately reflects what pollsters have seen for many years. Americans greatly exaggerate the scale of those items compared to everything else Washington spends on.",
      "To do our part to set the record straight, this chart comes from numbers in the president's 2017 budget request. There are different ways to tally expenses across more than a dozen agencies, but by and large, foreign aid represents about 1 percent of all spending.",
      "To support Kerry's claim, the State Department press office pointed to several reports including a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a widely respected source of impartial data. In January 2016, Kaiser found that only 3 percent of Americans correctly estimated spending at 1 percent or less of total spending. The average answer was that foreign aid accounts for 31 percent of the U.S. budget; 15 percent of the people thought it represented over half of all spending.",
      "",
      "",
      "That misconception is a stubborn one.",
      "In a 1998 survey, the average answer put foreign aid at 26 percent of the budget.",
      "And decades before that, nearly a quarter of respondents in a 1963 Gallup poll said Washington spends between 10 to 25 percent of its budget on foreign aid. Another 13 percent said it might go as high as half of all government spending.",
      "So the surveys back-up Kerry's statement.",
      "Which raises the question, why do so many people get it wrong?",
      "There are many possible reasons. The first and most obvious factor is that most Americans might not know much about foreign aid. In a 2010 poll, almost 70 percent said they had heard about the World Bank, but less that 30 percent had heard about the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government's main overseas health and development body.",
      "Boston College political scientist Emily Thorson points the finger at a more fundamental problem. It seems we aren't very good with numbers.",
      "\"People don't think in terms of percentages,\" Thorson said. \"We do best with more than' and 'less than.' And they also don't have a sense of how big the federal budget is. So if they hear we're spending billions, they don't see how that can be a small slice of the total.\"",
      "Researchers Helen Milner and Dustin Tingley, professors at Harvard and Princeton universities respectively, suggested that the way surveys ask about foreign aid might make that problem worse.",
      "\"No study that we are aware of asks individuals to assign percentages to an array of government programs, with a mandatory limit at 100 percent,\" they wrote in 2013.",
      "In other words, asking only about foreign aid might lead people to ignore the big ticket budget lines for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and defense.",
      "It's also possible, Thorson said, that news coverage that touches on aid can be graphic and compelling -- such as scenes from refugee camps or fighter jets in flight -- which leaves the impression that these programs play a bigger role in the budget than they actually do.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Kerry said that surveys show that many Americans think that a quarter to a third of the U.S. budget is spent on foreign aid. The actual number is about 1 percent, and surveys back up Kerry's statement. One 2016 poll found the average estimate was about 30 percent of all government spending. A survey done nearly two decades ago found an average estimate of 26 percent.",
      "There's nothing wrong about Kerry's summary.",
      "We rate this claim True.",

      "Some of the starkest statistics we see center around income inequality. A recent post from Oxfam America, the U.S. branch of the global anti-poverty group, particularly piqued our interest. Oxfam wants the presidential candidates to tackle the issue in their upcoming debate.",
      "\"The world's 62 richest people own the same wealth as the 3.6 billion poorest. What will you do to combat runaway inequality in the US and around the world?\" Oxfam America asked on Twitter.",
      "Is that so?",
      "It turns out Oxfam America isn't quite right. But the number is in the ballpark.",
      "Oxfam came up with the comparison in January using two different reports. The first, from Credit Suisse, estimated the distribution of household wealth worldwide. The second was Forbes' list of billionaires.",
      "We'll walk you through the calculations and a couple of caveats.",
      "The Credit Suisse report",
      "Analysts hired by Credit Suisse estimated total personal wealth at $250 trillion. From there, they estimated that the bottom half of the world's population (approximately 3.6 billion people) owned less than 1 percent of all wealth. To be precise, (and you can find this on page 110 of the full Credit Suisse databook) the bottom half of the world's population own .59 percent of world household wealth, which comes out to about $1.4 trillion.",
      "There are some caveats about the calculation.",
      "Raul Santaeulalia-Llopis, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis, said that Credit Suisse may have underestimated wealth in low-income countries but not enough to make the numbers much different.",
      "The strongest criticism of the Credit Suisse report is that it includes a significant number of people in wealthy countries who are not poor but have large debts. That produces misleading results, experts told us.",
      "\"(They) are not actually living in poverty but simply have very low or even negative net worth due to amassment of debt to finance housing, education and consumption beyond current income,\" Brent Beardsley, managing director at the Boston Consulting Group, said. \"In this case, wealth -- or rather net worth -- is not an adequate measure of what is commonly understood as poverty.\"",
      "Forbes billionaire estimates",
      "The second half of the comparison is relatively straightforward.",
      "Oxfam used Forbes' list of billionaires and counted how many people it would take to reach $1.4 trillion -- the figure representing the wealth of the bottom half of the global population.",
      "Forbes' calculations aren't perfect, but they are the best estimate publicly available. Forbes tracks changes in real time, but the base comparisons depend on estimates generated by members of the Forbes team. Sometimes the billionaires themselves say the numbers are off, because all the necessary information is not public knowledge. Then there are fluctuations due to changing currency exchange rates and the ups and downs of the stock market.",
      "The list can't deliver pinpoint accuracy, but it does represent a good faith effort to assess the net worth of the world's wealthiest people. Like the wealth calculations in the Credit Suisse report, it should be seen as a reasonable estimate.",
      "So what does Forbes say today, about 10 months after Oxfam wrote its report?",
      "According to the publisher, the world's wealthiest 54 people control $1.4 trillion -- the same amount attributed to the combined wealth of the bottom 50 percent of people living in the world.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Oxfam America said the world's 62 richest people own the same wealth as the 3.6 billion poorest. The Oxfam analysis was based on a report from Credit Suisse and the Forbes list of billionaires.",

      "The statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",

In December, he won passage of a law that uses $50 million in federal money to seed a private foundation aimed at ending forced labor and human trafficking for the sex trade.",
      "\"It's illegal in every country in the world, including ours,\" Corker said on MSNBC's Morning Joe on Feb. 15, 2017. \"But, today, 27 million people, as we speak on this program, are enslaved.\"",
      "That's a big number, and we looked into the research behind it.",

      "\"Many human trafficking and modern slavery victims are part of a hidden population, which unfortunately makes it almost impossible to count with 100 percent accuracy just how many human beings are trapped around the world,\" Corker told us. \"Fortunately, there are numbers of well-respected organizations that have done extensive work on this issue and give us a general sense of the magnitude of the problem.\"",
      "One advocacy group Corker relied on is End It, which cited estimates ranging from 20 million to 45.8 million.",
      "That's quite a span, which suggests considerable differences of opinion as to what constitutes slavery and how to measure it.",
      "Siddarth Kara, director of the Program on Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery at Harvard's Kennedy School, told us the 27-million figure has been in circulation for years.",
      "Kara gives more weight to the lower estimate of 20.9 million from the International Labor Organization's 2012 report on forced labor. That study found that 4.5 million people were trapped by sexual exploitation. Another 14.2 million were locked in work that ranged from mining, to agriculture, to domestic service and manufacturing.",
      "The situation is complex. They found that people such as migrant workers can move in and out of forced labor.",
      "In Kara's view, the truth lies between 20 and 40 million, and \"closer to the International Labor Organization metric, I believe.\"",
      "A key architect of the high-end estimate is Kevin Bales, professor of contemporary slavery at the University of Nottingham in England. Bales works closely with the Australian anti-slavery organization Walk Free to produce the Global Slavery Index. The index includes in its definition of slavery the same conditions as the International Labor Organization, but adds in child soldiers, child brides and other forced marriages.",
      "Bales told us \"the 45.8 million number is by far the most accurate.\" It is based, he said, on surveys and statistical models that have been checked against multiple measures.",
      "But many long-time researchers of modern slavery strongly criticize the methods behind the Global Slavery Index.",
      "\"The trouble with this potentially admirable effort is that the data on which these tables rely is usually second-hand and often of seriously poor quality,\" wrote Neil Howard, a fellow at the European University Institute in Florence.",
      "Howard studies labor exploitation in the West African nation of Benin, one of the highest-ranked trouble spots in the index. In an op-ed in the Guardian in 2014, he said the reality is different from the story told in the index.",
      "\"I worked with teenage boys who were said to be victims of trafficking and apparently forced from Benin to the artisanal quarries of Abeokuta, in Nigeria,\" Howard wrote. \"The adolescent boys I interviewed willingly migrate to the quarries as part of a highly structured migrant network providing labor for the Beninese expatriate community that runs the quarry economy.\"",
      "However, even ardent critics of the larger figures in the index still describe a problem that afflicts millions of people.",

      "In August 2014, as the race between former Gov. Pat Quinn and Bruce Rauner hit full throttle, no issue was more hotly contested than Rauner's charge that Quinn had reduced spending on K-12 education as state finances spiraled ever-downward under his leadership.",
      "Specifically, the Rauner campaign cited Illinois State Board of Education data that showed school funding going from $7.4 billion in Fiscal Year 2009 to $6.8 billion in FY 2015. Rauner said that amounted to a $600 million reduction. Quinn, however, said his administration actually increased state-level funding during that time by $442 million.",
      "Whether school funding increased or decreased from FY 2009 to FY 2015 depended on whether you counted $1.8 billion in federal economic stimulus money in your calculation. Rauner did, Quinn didn't. The issue never was settled, and seemed to disappear after Rauner defeated Quinn in the 2014 election.",
      "Then came Governor's Day at the Illinois State Fair on Aug. 17. Rauner is not up for election this year, but his legislative agenda is. His campaign fund in recent weeks has given $10 million to the Illinois Republican Party to support GOP candidates who are running against what Rauner describes as a \"corrupt machine\" run by Democrats. Throughout the summer, Rauner has revived some of the themes that were a big part of his own, successful campaign two years ago.",
      "As he rallied the Republican faithful at the fairgrounds for the final charge to Election Day, Rauner reached back into his 2014 campaign quiver for another shot at Democrats' stewardship of school funding in Illinois.",
      "\"They are strangling our state. They are driving jobs away. They are raising your taxes to the highest property taxes in America. They are building massive government bureaucracy everywhere, crushing our economy,\" Rauner told an enthusiastic crowd. \"They are cutting our school funding. Four times in the last 10 years before we came into office.\"",
      "So here we are again, almost exactly two years from when this debate first erupted, only this time the argument is expanded to include all Illinois Democrats and narrowed to \"four times\" that they cut school funding. We decided to dig back in and find out if it's true.",
      "Stimulus stigma",
      "Rauner's office provided us with figures from the Governor's Office of Management and Budget from FY 2000 to FY 2015 (the last year in which Illinois had a state budget) to illustrate the trend, and said the years referred to in the speech were FY 2010-FY 2013.",
      "",
      "During those years, elementary and secondary education funding went from $7.32 billion to $6.55 billion.",
      "Clearly there's a decline in school funding over that period. But was it the result of \"cutting,\" as Rauner claims, or because federal stimulus money ended?",
      "The Civic Federation, the respected government fiscal watchdog organization, took on the question through its Institute for Illinois' Fiscal Sustainability in a report in October 2014:",
      "\"General Funds spending on education in FY2010 is shown in budget documents as $7.3 billion. But that number includes $790.8 million in federal stimulus funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Some analysts might deduct that amount to maximize comparability, which would reduce the General Funds figure for FY2010 to $6.5 billion. Based on that calculation, General Funds spending on education increases by $358 million to $6.8 billion in FY2015. Similarly, budget documents in FY2009 show education spending at $7.4 billion, but that amount includes $1.0 billion of stimulus funding. Deducting that amount results in General Funds spending of $6.3 billion in FY2009 and an increase of $522 million to $6.8 billion in FY2015.\"",
      "The Civic Federation's analysis is impartial and it offers no opinion on which version -- including stimulus funding or excluding it -- is preferred. Thus it scrupulously avoids making a \"cut or no cut\" judgment.",
      "But it affirms the credibility of assessing state-level school funding in the post-recession years without the emergency federal money, which was designed to offset the Great Recession's economic downturn for school budgets. By that measure, the FY2010-FY2013 span we're examining would see school funding go from $6.541 billion in 2010 to $6.55 billion in 2013.",
      "Not robust growth, but not the precipitous $772 million decline shown when the federal money from 2010 is included.",
      "There's also a piece of evidence that both supports Quinn's claim in 2014 that he increased school funding and bolsters Rauner's argument about overall mismanagement of the state budget by Quinn as governor and, today, by the Democrats who control the General Assembly.",
      "Midway through FY 2011, Quinn and the Democratic majority passed a controversial, four-year income tax increase that raised the personal income tax from 3 to 5 percent and the corporate tax rate from 4.8 to 7 percent. The increase was intended to pay down the state's $6.5 billion in unpaid bills and prevent cuts to core services, including education.",
      "\"The governor led that fight to raise revenue in 2011 and allowed us to avoid radical cuts to education,\" Quinn campaign spokeswoman Brooke Anderson told the Associated Press in October 2014 as debate raged over whether Quinn had cut or increased education funding.",
      "Debate over that tax increase was a major component of the 2014 gubernatorial campaign. To Rauner, it was yet another dagger to the heart of Illinois' struggling economy, and a symptom of a Democratic party bereft of ideas to get Illinois back on track.",
      "To Quinn, it was a necessary if unpopular move to, among other things, preserve school funding.",
      "Two former state budget directors we contacted -- Steve Schnorf, who was Gov. George Ryan's budget director from 1997-2002, and Joan Walters, who worked under Gov. Jim Edgar from 1991 to 1997 -- declined an invitation to weigh in on the main question here. But both said an important clue in making a ruling would come from examining how the stimulus money was used.",
      "If used to replace state funding missing due to the bad economy, as it was intended, then its loss should not be interpreted as a cut. If the state used it to fund programs or projects that would prove unsustainable when the money went away, Rauner's assessment would be accurate.",
      "But improper use of the funding never was at issue. Rauner's statements during the campaign two years ago and again this year dealt strictly with the numbers.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Rauner said of Democrats, \"They are cutting our school funding. Four times in the last 10 years before we came into office.\"",
      "Rauner's office said the years referred to in the speech were FY 2010-2013.",
      "While school funding did decline in fiscal years 2010-2013, it's inaccurate to say it happened because of \"cutting.\"",
      "In fact, as noted by the Civic Federation and in state budgets from the years in question, state-level funding -- which is controlled by the General Assembly and the governor -- increased slightly during those four years. Expand the years to FY 2009-2015 and the increase in state funding came to $522 million.",
      "Quinn's record tax increase of 2011 is perhaps the greatest piece of evidence in support of Quinn's aversion to cutting and in support of his claim that he boosted school funding.",
      "Illinois for two years has been a philosophical battleground in which Republicans, led by Rauner, have argued that Illinois' abysmal unemployment rate is the product of 12 years of Democratic control of state government. Much of their argument has involved Democratic policies that they believe have made Illinois an unfriendly state for business.",
      "But in claiming that Democrats cut school spending in the final years of their hold on the governor's office, Rauner resurrects an allegation that should have stayed buried after he won the election.",

      "Speaking at an event in Chicago earlier this month, U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., was talking tax policy and the economy when he pointed to lackluster economic growth that occurred under former President Barack Obama.",
      "\"The past (Obama) administration was the first administration that never had a whole year of 3 percent growth,\" Roskam said during a March 6 speech at the City Club of Chicago.",
      "It's an oft-cited figure Republicans tend to throw around to highlight the weak economic recovery throughout Obama's presidency, but does the data back it up?",
      "A familiar claim",
      "Roskam's claim lacks some specifics, particularly the type of growth and time frame he was referring to in his speech.",
      "David Pasch, the Wheaton Republican's communications director, provided a link to data compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis showing both the annual and quarterly percentage change in real gross domestic product, or GDP, which is the total value of goods and services provided in the country.",
      "While annual figures on GDP growth date back to the Herbert Hoover administration and the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, the federal government did not start tracking quarterly growth until 1947.",
      "Considering the time frame for which this annual data is available, it's safe to assume Roskam was referring to economic growth since the Hoover administration.",
      "In fact, Roskam's claim is quite similar to a statement Donald Trump made during a campaign speech in October, which was fact-checked by our colleague Joshua Gillin at PolitiFact Florida.",
      "As was the case with Trump's claim, Roskam is right when he says that year-over-year GDP growth never topped 3 percent while Obama was in office.",
      "But as Princeton University economist Alan Blinder told PolitiFact at the time, looking at annual data can be misleading because it doesn't provide context or account for historical factors that affect economic growth, such as recessions and global crises. For example, Hoover came into office on the cusp of the Great Depression, and Obama took over during the tail end of the Great Recession and amid instability in the Middle East.",
      "That's one of the main reasons why economists suggest looking at the percentage change in GDP by quarters, rather than growth in a single calendar year.",
      "When PolitiFact Florida fact-checked Trump saying Obama was the first president \"in modern history not to have a single year of 3 percent growth,\" data for the third and fourth quarters of 2016 was not yet available.",
      "But now it is.",
      "GDP growth in 2016 and the Obama years",
      "According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the percentage change in GDP growth during the third and fourth quarters of the last year of Obama's final term was 3.5 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, resulting in an average growth rate of 1.6 percent for 2016.",
      "That was down 1 percentage point from 2015 when GDP grew by 2.6 percent, which marked the best year for average growth under Obama.",
      "Typically, economic growth in the first quarter of a new presidency is attributed to the previous administration, meaning former President George W. Bush gets credit for the 5.4 percent contraction in the economy during the first three months of 2009.",
      "As for the remainder of Obama's time in office, quarterly GDP growth averaged 2.0 percent, or 1.5 percent when averaging out annual figures.",
      "But if the data is used to compare one quarter to the same quarter from a year ago, there were two periods during Obama's tenure in which growth exceeded 3 percent. Between the third quarters of 2009 and 2010, GDP growth was about 3.1 percent; and between the first quarters of 2014 and 2015, the economy grew by 3.3 percent, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.",
      "With the way Roskam refers to growth, however, Obama indeed was the first president who did not achieve more than 3 percent growth in GDP. Average growth under Bush Sr., was 2.1 percent; 3.9 percent for Bill Clinton; 2.3 percent for George H.W. Bush; and 3.5 percent for Ronald Reagan.",
      "The highest annual growth on record occurred in 1942 during the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, when GDP grew by a staggering 18.9 percent as the United States entered World War II and ramped up production following the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Roskam said the Obama \"administration was the first administration that never had a whole year of 3 percent growth.\"",
      "While Roskam's claim is accurate when based on annual GDP growth figures between 2009 and 2016, there are other ways to look at the data, such as from one quarter to the same in the previous year. Doing so reveals economic growth has surpassed 3 percent during two periods of Obama's presidency.",

      "Facing questions from reporters on Oct. 2 about whether the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history would stir action on gun control, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called up a page straight from the campaign playbook of her boss.",
      "\"I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country. That certainly hasn't helped there,\" Sanders said. \"So, I think we have to, when that time comes for those conversations to take place, then I think we have to look at things that may actually have a real impact.\"",
      "Sanders' statement was nearly identical to that of her boss nearly a year ago.",
      "During his third debate with Hillary Clinton in October 2016, Donald Trump used Chicago to bolster his belief in the folly of fighting gun crime with stricter gun laws.",
      "\"In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump was correct that Chicago's gun violence led the nation. But a check by PolitiFact Illinois revealed that he was wrong by a long shot about the city having \"the toughest gun laws in the United States.\"",
      "Just about anyone who follows crime trends and gun regulations in the U.S. with any degree of seriousness knows by now that the \"Chicago-as-gun-law-Mecca\" charge is a canard that lost its last vestige of credibility more than four years ago, when Illinois became the last state in the nation to allow concealed carry of firearms.",
      "Trump, following the rhetoric lead of many other strong gun rights advocates, has over the years frequently pointed to Chicago as \"proof\" that gun ownership restrictions not only fail to reduce crime, but exacerbate it.",
      "The most stringent gun laws in the U.S. happen to be in Chicago - and look what is happening there!",
      "Sanders took Trump's illogical and invalid argument a step further. Now Chicago's handgun ownership history proves that mass shootings committed with automatic weapons can't be prevented with legal restrictions.",
      "Here's why Sanders and all of those who continue to repeat her statement on social media and elsewhere are wrong about Chicago's gun laws.",
      "Chicago's reputation for strict gun laws is rooted in its 1982 ban on handguns. When the U.S. Supreme Court's District of Columbia vs. Heller decision in 2008 struck down a similar ban in the District of Columbia, Chicago was the only major city left with a blanket handgun prohibition. The distinction didn't last long.",
      "In 2010, the high court followed up Heller with a ruling in McDonald vs. City of Chicago which nullified Chicago's ban. At that, the concealed carry of firearms was still outlawed in Chicago as it was throughout all of Illinois.",
      "Two years later, however, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the Illinois concealed carry ban as unconstitutional and the state soon after became the last in the nation to approve concealed carry.",
      "As we noted last year in fact-checking Trump's Chicago-bashing:",
      "With that, Chicago lost its status -- or its stigma, depending on your perspective -- of having the strictest gun possession laws in the United States. In comparably sized big cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, the city administers the concealed-carry permitting process. In Illinois, the Illinois State Police processes applications, so it can be argued that Chicago has less autonomy in restricting concealed carry within its borders than do other cities.",
      "We also noted last year that the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for stricter gun laws, found Illinois' firearm laws too lenient in several ways, all of which still apply:",
      "Illinois' gun laws still are considered among the most restrictive when compared with other states. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for gun control, gives Illinois a B+ and ranks it No. 8 in the nation on its \"Smart Gun Laws\" report card. The group lauds Illinois for, among several rules, requiring firearm owners to obtain a Firearm Owners' ID card that includes a background check and imposes a waiting period on firearm purchases.",
      "But it also knocks Illinois for not requiring registration of firearms, for its lack of restriction on the purchase of multiple firearms and for not allowing local jurisdictions to regulate firearms. In other words, Illinois could make its gun laws much more strict than they are.",
      "Seven states receive higher grades than Illinois in the latest Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence ratings.",
      "In last year's fact-check, we noted that Trump's statement also could have been interpreted as Chicago having strict gun laws because it imposed strict penalties on those who violate them or use guns in crimes. Even staunch gun rights advocates have argued that this approach can be an effective crime deterrent where restrictions on lawful gun ownership are both unconstitutional and ineffective.",
      "Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel had for several years pushed unsuccessfully for a new state law containing harsher penalties for repeat gun offenders. A 2014 report by the Chicago Sun-Times found that lenient sentencing for gun offenders was a factor in repeat offenses. That was where things stood when Trump made his statement in 2016.",
      "That changed on June 23, when Gov. Bruce Rauner signed into law a bill that, among other things, increased the minimum sentence for repeat gun offenders from three to seven years. Thus even the argument that Chicago favors getting tough on lawful gun owners over cracking down on gun criminals no longer applies.",
      "Sanders, fielding questions about the impact of the Las Vegas massacre, pointed to chronic gun violence in Chicago as proof that tough gun laws were ineffective. \"I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country,\" she said. \"That certainly hasn't helped there,\"",
      "There was a brief time between 2008 and 2010 -- the window during which Washington, D.C.'s handgun ban had been invalidated but Chicago's still stood -- where that might have been true. But federal court rulings effectively undid city and state laws severely restricting gun use and ownership in the Chicago. When it comes to the concealed carry of weapons, Chicago has less authority to impose limitations than do many other large U.S. cities.",
      "In the thick of 2016 presidential campaign, we rated a nearly identical statement from then candidate Trump as Mostly False. Since then, similar claims have been uttered frequently by others and repeatedly debunked.",
      "Sanders therefore has had ample opportunity to learn her boss had been flat wrong when making the same claim on the campaign trail. Her revival of the claim, made in the midst of the debate raging over the Las Vegas massacre, is at best intellectually lazy and at worst a deliberate attempt to mislead.",

      "As mayor of north suburban Highland Park, Nancy Rotering has been in the thick of the debate over gun control in recent years.",
      "Since 2013, her suburb has prohibited weapons like the semiautomatic rifle used to kill 17 Parkland, Florida, high school students and teachers on Valentine's Day. The Illinois city's gun ban has survived a court challenge, with the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015 refusing to hear an appeal of a ruling that upheld the Highland Park law. The practical effect of that decision was to signal other local governments that they could legally impose bans on certain types of military-style guns without violating the Second Amendment.",
      "But Rotering, one of eight Democrats vying in the March 20 primary for their party's nomination for Attorney General, said there's still a catch in state law that prevents other Illinois towns from following Highland Park's example.",
      "Just days before the Parkland shooting, Rotering told the Sun-Times this: \"We in Highland Park banned assault weapons and were taken to the United States Supreme Court and we prevailed. It's now constitutional to ban these weapons of war in Illinois. Yet, the Illinois General Assembly has failed to allow other cities to have that opportunity.\"",
      "Nothing is ever simple when it comes to inevitably bitter disputes over gun restrictions versus gun rights, and that clearly is the case with the fate of assault weapons bans in Illinois. If the Supreme Court says Rotering's Highland Park can impose a ban, why then does she say that other communities are prevented from doing the same? We decided to take a look.",
      "In 2013, Illinois became the last state to allow the concealed carry of guns when the legislature approved it under pressure from a federal appellate court ruling. A few years prior to that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a blanket handgun ban imposed by Chicago.",
      "When it comes to even more lethal firepower, the gun debate can get especially perplexing, with those for or against gun controls often sounding as if they speak different languages. While the term \"assault weapon\" is commonly used to describe firearms used in mass shootings, advocacy organizations like the Illinois State Rifle Association (an affiliate of the National Rifle Association) refuses to refer to semi-automatic rifles that fire a single round each time a trigger is pulled as assault weapons.",
      "Nonetheless, ordinances like that in Highland Park that ban semi-automatics often refer to them as assault weapons. Similarly, the package of Illinois laws that allowed concealed carry also included a clause designed to block imposition of piecemeal weapons bans from town to town.",
      "\"The regulation of the possession or ownership of assault weapons are exclusive powers and functions of this State,\" the statute reads.",
      "It was that language that stripped local governments of their authority to pass their restricting semi-automatic rifles, ammunition magazines and related weapons and devices.",
      "\"Local control of certain things are bad,\" said Richard Pearson, executive director of the Illinois State Rifle Association. \"If they want to tax someone to death, I don't care. They can build roads, but the Second Amendment is a fundamental right.\"",
      "Two lawmakers instrumental in passing the concealed carry legislation, Sen. Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, and Rep. Lou Lang, D-Skokie, said the local restriction language was the price gun-rights advocates insisted on to reach a compromise.",
      "\"There was a constant battle between the pro-gun and gun-safety advocates,\" Lang said in an interview.",
      "The measures included a narrow loophole, however. They went into effect July 9, 2013, but gave local governments a 10-day window past that date to pass local assault weapons bans. Highland Park, Chicago, Evanston and Skokie were among the few local governments that took advantage of the opening. Cook County updated an existing ban, effectively extending it to all other suburbs in the county.",
      "Two years later, state Sen. Julie Morrison, D-Deerfield, introduced legislation to reinstate power to local governments to pass assault weapons, but it languished in committee and eventually died.",
      "Morrison said she is considering another try in the wake of the Florida shooting. Meanwhile, the Illinois House is expected this week to consider several different bills aimed at gun control, including a proposed state licensing system for gun dealers.",
      "Rotering says: \"It's now constitutional to ban these weapons of war in Illinois. Yet, the Illinois General Assembly has failed to allow other cities to have that opportunity.\"",
      "While there's much disagreement about how to respond to the problem of gun violence, Illinois' law on banning powerful rifles, commonly referenced as assault weapons, is clear. Only the state of Illinois and not local governments can pass an assault weapons ban, although local governments like Rotering's Highland Park were granted a narrow and long-since expired window to approve their own bans.",
      "Those provisions were included by lawmakers in a 2013 law that allowed the concealed carry of weapons in Illinois.",
      "In claiming that the \"Illinois General Assembly has failed\" to reopen the door to local weapons bans, Rotering resorts to language that to some lawmakers seems over the top because she appears to be equating inaction with failure. But the essence of her claim is correct.",
      "Lawmakers inclined to back Morrison's proposal acknowledge it has lacked the votes to pass up to now. Even so, the Legislature has had the opportunity to revisit the issue and did not do so.",

Considering all opioids (not just prescribed ones), the figures get even worse: In 2015, 33,091 died from opioid related overdoses.",
      "Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill has set her sights on curbing the issue, writing an op-ed in the Kansas City Star and dedicating a page of her website to facts and figures. One tweet in particular caught our eye: \"We have 5% of world population. 80% of opioids.\"",
      "Such drastic numbers paint a dire picture for the state of opioid use and abuse in America. We wanted to fact-check her claim.",
      "What we found was that while America certainly consumes more opioids than any other country, the notion that we consume 80 percent of the global supply is greatly exaggerated.",
      "One startling number'",
      "Checking the first part of McCaskill's claim was simple: The United States' population is, according to the U.S. Census bureau, 324.8 million. The global population is 7.4 billion. That means the United States accounts for roughly 4.4 percent of the total world population.",
      "Checking the other half was more complicated.",
      "We reached out to McCaskill's spokesperson, Drew Pusateri, and he supplied us with the source of the figure: a CNBC article published on April 27, 2016.",
      "And while the article provides the figures McCaskill cited, it is vague about where exactly the 80 percent figure comes from. Upon its first reference it is simply \"one startling number from recent years,\" and later it is noted that the figure was \"cited in various studies,\" including one by Express Scripts.",
      "The Express Scripts study, \"A Nation In Pain,\" was released on Dec. 9, 2014. And while it does cite the 80 percent figure, it was not a study designed to measure American opioid consumption or global consumption.",
      "The reality, according to Christopher Jones, the director of the Division of Science Policy in the Department of Health and Human Services, is that America consumes 30.2 percent of globally distributed opioids.",
      "30.2 percent",
      "According to data collected by the International Narcotics Control Board, the United States consumed roughly 30.2 percent of opioids in 2015.",
      "A Vienna-based \"quasi-judicial expert body,\" the International Narcotics Control Board is tasked with tracking global opioid consumption, among a myriad of other things.",
      "The board releases three annual reports on narcotic drugs. \"Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2017; Statistics for 2015\" is the most recent publication, and includes data for the year 2015.",
      "Using the International Narcotics Control Board figures, Jones calculated that the United States consumed 173,332 kilograms of 574,693 kilograms of opioids consumed globally (382,131.6 of 1,266,981.2 pounds), or 30.2 percent.",
      "The drugs Jones included in the measurements are: codeine, dihydrocodeine, ethylmorphine, hydrocodone, morphine, oxycodone, pholcodine, dextropropoxyphene, diphenoxylate, methadone, pethidine and tilidine. The figures also include the calculated consumption of buprenorphine.",
      "To be clear, Jones noted, such data is limited in several ways. The first is that it is government-reported data. The second is that many drugs are marketed in one country and not another; while used frequently in the United States, hydrocodone is virtually unused elsewhere.",
      "Additionally, some of the data include drugs that may have been exported from the country of manufacture and consumed in another country. Thus, data from INCB should be considered with great care when comparing consumption levels of narcotic drugs across countries.",
      "And finally, the board makes special note that comparing countries by the weight of opioids consumed is not recommended. Instead they suggest using a statistical measurement called \"defined daily doses.\"",
      "Defined daily doses",
      "A defined daily dose is the quantity of a particular narcotic drug used in a day by one individual. It is not a recommended dosage, but rather it is a calculation created by the International Narcotics Control Board to statistically measure opioid use with a ratio that directly relates a country's population to its consumption.",
      "For example, the daily dose of hydrocodone is 15 milligrams. So, if 60 milligrams are consumed, four defined daily doses would be recorded. The final results are calculated per million inhabitants.",
      "The United States consumed the most using this measure from 2013 to 2015: 47,580 doses of narcotic drugs were consumed per day per million people.",
      "Canada comes in second with 34,444 defined doses consumed per day, and Germany in third with 30,796.",
      "Using such a measurement, it is easy to see that consumption in America, while noticeably higher than in similarly developed countries, is not as astronomical as McCaskill's cited figure makes it appear.",
      "A life of its own'",
      "Jones said it's common for people to cite the 80 percent figure that McCaskill did, despite its inaccuracy.",
      "\"I would say it is a commonly quoted statistic...people across a variety of disciplines, who even are somewhat expert on the topic, have repeated that statistic,\" he said.",
      "Jones said he believes the number originated as the percentage of oxycodone that America consumes compared to the world.",
      "From there, he said, the figure has \"taken a life of its own. It's now a fact' because it's been repeated so many times.\"",
      "But it's not the full picture. Because while America does consume over 75 percent of oxycodone, and 99 percent of hydrocodone, it doesn't consume even half of all opioids globally, according to the International Narcotics Control Board data.",
      "Which, in part, according to Jones, has to do with marketing. Oxycodone and hydrocodone are marketed in America. Similar opioids are more prevalent elsewhere.",
      "Drug control systems",
      "Despite conflated numbers, experts agree there is a problem.",
      "Martha Maurer, a policy program manager and researcher at the Pain and Policy Studies Group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, agreed that opioid abuse in the United States was an epidemic.",
      "But part of the solution, she said, was continuing to figure out how to view the problem.",
      "\"It's clear that there has been a lot of harm associated with overdose and abuse,\" Maurer said, \"but it goes back to the question of where (abused) medication is coming from, which we just don't know.\"",
      "Something worth noting, Maurer said, was that when you look at the milligram-per-person statistics, \"some countries, including Germany, Austria, Denmark and Switzerland, have opioid-consumption levels comparable to that in the US, but they are not having the same problems with harms caused by overdose. Their drug-control systems ensure a balanced approach to opioid access.\"",
      "For Jones, it's about finding the right balance.",
      "\"From a policy perspective, we're trying to ensure that opioids are available when they are needed, but that they are being used as a part of comprehensive evidence-based pain care,\" he said, \"not that we're relying on them just because they're the easiest thing to prescribe, or there are other external pressures to prescribe them.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "In setting out to combat America's opioid epidemic by holding pharmaceutical companies accountable, Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill said that with just 5 percent of the population, the United States consumes \"80 percent of opioids.\"",
      "McCaskill's figure, widely cited as it is, is inaccurate. It presents a narrow view of opioid consumption globally, where some opioids are marketed in select countries, but not others. It also discounts using defined daily doses, which provide a far more accurate representation of consumption when comparing nations.",
      "So, while the United States is clearly the largest consumer of opioids, it, at most, accounts for roughly 30 percent of global consumption. We rate McCaskill's claim False."

      "National and state Democrats are trying to tie Nevada Republican Senate candidate Joe Heck to the controversial immigration policies of Donald Trump,including Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto.",
      "In a recent news release, Cortez Masto's campaign called the two Republicans \"ideological soul mates.\"",
      "\"Just on the issue of immigration alone, it is next to impossible to find a policy difference between Trump and Congressman Heck,\" stated Cortez Masto's release.",
      "With immigration being a top concern for Nevada's sizable Hispanic population, we thought it was worth comparing the two candidates to see if it really is \"next to impossible\" to find a policy difference.",
      "Priorities",
      "On the surface level, there are many policy differences on immigration between Heck and Trump.",
      "Trump's immigration platform is detailed on his campaign website, and centers around three topics previously distilled by PolitiFact:",
      "Build a border wall across the U.S.-Mexico border, and require Mexico to make a one-time $5 to $10 billion payment to pay for it.",
      "Increase enforcement of immigration laws, including ending birthright citizenship and ending funding for so-called sanctuary cities.",
      "Focus on American workers, including halting green cards for foreign workers until more domestic workers are hired and increasing the minimum prevailing wage for H-1B visa program recipients.",
      "Heck's campaign and House websites acknowledge a \"broken\" immigration system but focus on different policy solutions. While echoing Trump in calling for implementing a mandatory E-verify system for employers and calling for increased border security, Heck says he's open to granting citizenship or legal status to people not legally in the country if his other proposals are addressed in a \"meaningful\" way.",
      "Both campaigns sent lengthy responses to PolitiFact. One thing is clear: There is daylight between Heck and Trump on a number of immigration policies.",
      "Birthright citizenship",
      "Democrats claim Heck and Trump share identical positions on wanting to \"end birthright citizenship and repeal the 14th Amendment.\"",
      "It's true both Republicans have mentioned re-examining the concept of jus soli extending citizenship based on place of birth, not parental nationality but Heck and Trump differ on rhetoric.",
      "Trump explicitly calls for an end to the policy, calling it the \"biggest magnet for illegal immigration.\" (He also cites Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid's 1993 bill \"clarifying\" the concept, though Reid later called it the \"low point\" of his legislative career.)",
      "Heck has also called for a similar re-examination of the policy, but in a less direct tone.",
      "His most pointed comments came in 2012, where a tracker captured Heck saying he supported changing the concept.",
      "\"My personal opinion is that if you're gonna be a citizen be considered a citizen you should be born to at least one parent that's a U.S. citizen,\" he said at the time.",
      "Heck generally hasn't gone as far since then, most recently telling a Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter that \"it needs to be part of the discussion\" but stopping short of a full endorsement.",
      "Legal scholars generally agree that birthright citizenship is on solid constitutional ground, but several believe it would only take a congressional act to \"clarify\" citizenship for children born of people not legally in the United States, and point out that the court has never fully adjudicated the issue.",
      "2013 immigration bill",
      "Cortez Masto says Heck and Trump both opposed the 2013 bipartisan immigration legislation, commonly referred to as the \"Gang of Eight\" bill. That glosses over important parts of the story.",
      "In 2013, Heck described the legislation as having positives and negatives but ultimately said he'd vote against the Senate bill as written, pointing to concerns over border security and wanting to toughen the education requirements for the children of people not legally in the country looking to apply for citizenship.",
      "The bill never received a House vote, but Heck still took independent action on the immigration bill. The Republican worked on draft legislation providing a pathway to citizenship for people illegally brought into the country as children, and publicly criticized House leadership in 2013 for failing to vote on any immigration legislation.",
      "Trump, on the other hand, told Bloomberg that he only really started following the immigration debate since he started running for president in 2015. \"When I made my (announcement) speech at Trump Tower, the June 16 speech, I didn't know about the Gang of Eight. I just knew instinctively that our borders are a mess,\" he said in May.",
      "This is contradicted by several tweets and interviews Trump did in 2013, calling the legislation a \"death wish\" for the Republican Party. Trump later criticized primary rival Marco Rubio's involvement in the legislation, calling it \"nothing more than a giveaway to the corporate patrons who run both parties.\"",
      "DREAMers/DACA",
      "One of Heck's most notable forays into the immigration debate was a failed attempt to bring forward a Republican version of the long-languishing Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act.",
      "Heck worked for around six months to try to find a compromise path supported by both parties, businesses and immigration activists before trying to roll out the measure in December 2013.",
      "Heck's version of the legislation, which had a pathway to citizenship for immigrants brought unlawfully into the country as children, fell flat after immigration activists and several other stakeholders declined to back the proposal over concerns that it only addressed part of the problem and wanted to hold out for a more comprehensive immigration plan.",
      "Additionally, Heck has voted against funding for Obama's executive orders allowing undocumented children and their parents to receive work permits and exemptions from deportation. He's on the record voting for several amendments that would strip the program's funding and voted in 2015 to block funding for an expansion of the program while joining with 25 other House Republicans to support the existing program.",
      "In the past, Heck has tried to frame his mixed voting record on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals in terms of his stated opposition to the president's use of executive orders establishing the programs.",
      "Trump is clearly opposed to the issue, and in 2015 called for the full rescission of executive orders protecting DREAMers from deportation, as well as the mass deportation of the roughly 11 million people not legally in the country. He's also publicly opposed the DREAM Act itself.",
      "Heck has routinely called Trump's proposals unrealistic.",
      "\"I don't think they can find, round up and afford to deport 11 million people,\" he told reporters in March.",
      "The wall/border security",
      "Heck also differs on Trump's signature piece of immigration policy building a massive border wall with Mexico.",
      "The Heck campaign provided PolitiFact with a form letter sent to constituents who ask about the proposed border wall. The letter stresses Heck's commitment to border security while gently dismissing Trump's plan for a massive, thousand-mile concrete wall as being inefficient.",
      "\"Physical barriers are certainly effective in areas with high cross-border traffic; however, there are vast stretches of our border that have relatively few crossings, and preventing these crossings could be more easily achieved through other methods,\" he says in the letter.",
      "Part of Heck's stated reasoning for opposing the 2013 immigration bill had to do with border security the Republican specifically called for additional border fencing and for more manpower along the border to stop illegal crossings.",
      "H1-B visas",
      "Trump and Heck also differ on what to do with temporary H1-B visas for skilled foreign workers.",
      "Trump's plan explicitly calls to increase the minimum prevailing wage (an averaged wage paid to workers in a similar field) for H1-B recipients over fears that the program depresses wages for American workers. It also makes an unspecified point of forcing companies to hire American workers before foreign workers in the visa program.",
      "Heck's campaign provided PolitiFact with a form letter sent to voters who ask about limiting the visas, which details Heck's concerns that scaling back the program could hurt economic growth.",
      "\"By restricting H-1B visas, growth in the U.S. in STEM fields could be restricted,\" Heck says in the letter.",
      "Sanctuary cities",
      "Another area of immigration policy overlap for Trump and Heck is in defunding so-called \"sanctuary cities,\" or areas where local law enforcement doesn't routinely report undocumented migrants to immigration authorities.",
      "There's no agreed-upon or legal definition of a \"sanctuary city,\" and use of the moniker is somewhat fluid.",
      "Trump seized the issue after the shooting death of Kate Steinle in San Francisco last year by an undocumented immigrant who had been deported five times, and has forcefully called for cutting off federal grants to cities that refuse to cooperate with federal law enforcement.",
      "While he hasn't been as vocal as Trump, Heck did vote to block federal law enforcement funds from sanctuary cities as part of a House bill in July 2015. The White House promised to veto the measure, which has defeated in a procedural vote by Senate Democrats.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Cortez Masto claims that \"on the issue of immigration alone, it is next to impossible to find a policy difference between (Donald) Trump and Congressman (Joe) Heck.\"",
      "There are areas where Heck and Trump overlap on immigration policy: mandatory E-verify for employers, upping border security and questioning birthright citizenship.",
      "However, Cortez Masto made it sound like Heck and Trump are lockstep on the issue, and that's clearly not the case.",
      "There are major stated policy differences between the two Republicans Heck opposes mass deportation, which Trump campaigned on during the primary season. And Heck has supported a pathway to citizenship for people not legally in the country, as well as supported a version of the DREAM Act.",
      "It wasn't \"next to impossible\" to find those differences. We rate this statement False.",

      "Sanders supporters loudly protested both during and after the convention, which saw Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton officially claim 20 pledged delegates to Sanders' 15.",
      "Nevada's delegate allocation process is complex, but Sanders supporters have accused the state Democratic Party of various crimes including ignoring attempts to change the rules, rigging the process in favor of Clinton and disqualifying several dozen delegates that supported Sanders.",
      "Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver reiterated those concerns during a May 18 interview on CNN with John Vause.",
      "\"There was a horrendous breakdown, where the leadership there in Nevada hijacked the process on the floor, created a tremendous amount of angst among people who were there attending the convention, who were supporters of Sen. Sanders, by ignoring the regular procedure and ramming through what they wanted to do,\" he said.",
      "There's little disagreement that the convention was chaotic. PolitiFact Nevada was at the convention and saw it firsthand. But does the Sanders campaign's complaints have merit?",
      "What was at stake",
      "Nevada's presidential caucuses were held back in February, which saw Clinton defeat Sanders by a roughly 5 percent margin among the roughly 80,000 voters who participated.",
      "But Nevada's process of allocating delegates isn't so cut and dried, as PolitiFact has previously explained.",
      "Only 23 of the state's 43 delegates are officially locked in as a result of the February caucuses. Clinton won 13 of that pool, while Sanders won 10.",
      "Another group of eight are so-called \"superdelegates,\" who aren't bound to any candidate and independently decide who to support. (Five currently support Clinton and one backs Sanders in Nevada.)",
      "That leaves 12 delegates technically up for grabs at the state convention in May. That number is made up of five pledged \"party leader and elected official\" delegates and seven \"at-large\" delegates awarded proportionally, so whichever campaign has the majority at the state convention \"wins\" the odd-numbered delegate from those two groups.",
      "Barring a total collapse from either campaign, this means that one candidate was to get seven delegates at the state convention and the other was to get five.",
      "As PolitiFact wrote in April, the process is supposed to look something like a Matryoshka doll smaller amounts of delegates at each step of the process, but retaining the same proportions of the initial February caucus.",
      "But that model was essentially broken during the April county conventions, where less than half of Clinton's allocated county delegates showed up, leading Sanders to declare a surprise victory and allocated delegate advantage over Clinton (2,124 to 1,792) heading into the state convention.",
      "Convention confusion",
      "Tensions were already mounting in the weeks before the convention, with a small group of Sanders supporters filing a lawsuit against the state party (which was dismissed by a Las Vegas judge) and creating a petition demanding the convention rules be changed.",
      "The fight over rules had been going on since April, according to an email chain posted by Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston, between Sanders superdelegate Erin Bilbray and party chairwoman Roberta Lange.",
      "Supporters of Sanders believed that the convention rules, which have been largely the same since 2008, gave an unfair amount of power to Lange, the convention chair. The rules specifically lay out that all convention votes must be done by voice vote, and that only the convention chair can declare the winner or call for a more specific method of voting among the thousands of delegates.",
      "The rules, which can be read here, also state that any amendment attempts must be approved by two-thirds of the convention delegates which would be difficult given the nearly even number of Clinton and Sanders backers present.",
      "Sanders backers say the continuing nature of the presidential primary necessitated more rule changes.",
      "The Sanders campaign did not respond to a request for comment. In a previous statement, the campaign detailed several allegations of misconduct from the state party, which we considered as part of this fact-check. \"At that convention the Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place,\" the campaign said in that statement.",
      "However, there were no last minute rule changes sprung on convention-goers the rules had been publicly available weeks in advance, largely unchanged for three presidential cycles, and given to both campaigns.",
      "The first major fight happened in the morning, with the convention being gaveled in nearly 40 minutes after the scheduled 9 a.m. start time.",
      "In a voice vote, Lange approved adoption of a preliminary credentials report showing more Clinton than Sanders delegates. Immediate howls of protests from the Sanders contingent emerged, many of whom rushed the dais and started screaming insults and obscenities directly at Lange.",
      "Although several videos from the event appear to have louder \"nays\" than \"yeas,\" both preliminary and final delegate counts showed that Clinton supporters outnumbered Sanders supporters in the room.",
      "And trying to determine the outcome of a voice vote from a video of around 3,000 delegates is somewhat arbitrary to begin with. The only person with authority to call for a different voting mechanism is the convention chair: Lange.",
      "Regardless, upset Sanders supporters rushed the main stage, hurling obscenities at Lange and other members of the party's executive board and booing over remarks from California Sen. Barbara Boxer delivered on behalf of the Clinton campaign.",
      "The Sanders campaign later alleged that Lange refused to accept petitions to change the rules, which is inaccurate.",
      "In an interview, Lange said the board received a handful of petitions to change the convention rules but not all of them met the requirement to have signatures by 20 percent of convention goers.",
      "Lange said the proper procedure for an amendment to the rules would have been during a short period for public comment before the temporary rules were adopted as permanent.",
      "None of the three Sanders supporters who spoke, including Nevada superdelegate Erin Bilbray, made any motion to amend the rules during that time, so they were approved as written.",
      "Volunteers circulating the petitions changing the rules abandoned their efforts after the permanent rules were adopted, saying they missed their chance to introduce them.",
      "Either way, any rule change would require a two-thirds majority vote which would be highly unlikely given the Clinton campaign's public opposition to any rules changes.",
      "More controversies erupted after the party's credentials committee, which consisted of five Clinton and five Sanders backers, released their report showing that Clinton delegates narrowly outnumbered those of Sanders 1,695 to 1,662 a 33-delegate margin.",
      "Again, Nevada's delegate allocation rules meant that whichever campaign had the majority of delegates at the state convention would win two delegates to the national convention.",
      "Minority Report",
      "A constant complaint is that the party's credentials committee unfairly disqualified 64 Sanders delegates detailed in a \"minority report\" and read to delegates by a pro-Sanders credentials committee member.",
      "Sanders supporters were upset because that number of delegates would have tipped the balance and presumably swung the two national delegates back to Sanders.",
      "But there are a lot of misconceptions and misunderstandings associated with the report, which was written and circulated by Sanders campaign staffers.",
      "Annette Magnus, an activist and credentials committee member, said the 64-delegate figure stems from a list of delegates submitted by the Clinton campaign of Sanders delegates who weren't registered as Democrats by May 1, which is required under the rules.",
      "Magnus said the committee spent much of Saturday investigating the delegates called into question, and eventually seated six of them. The remaining 58 delegates were rejected because they were either not Democrats by May 1 or the party could not confirm their name or address.",
      "\"There was not a vetting process at county convention like the state level convention,\" Magnus said.",
      "Importantly, the state party reported only eight of the rejected delegates even showed up to the convention, so even if they had been seated it would not have flipped the majority.",
      "\"It didn't affect the outcome in any way,\" Magnus said.",
      "Regardless, the switch in two delegates matters little in the contours of the national delegate race.",
      "Including superdelegates, Clinton has a commanding 763 delegate lead over Sanders after the May 17 primaries, according to the Associated Press. Clinton currently leads the delegate count in Nevada 25-16, with two superdelegates still undecided.",
      "Security concerns",
      "With so many questions about the Nevada convention, we wanted to address two other points.",
      "Images and videos circulated after the convention was called to a quick close alleging that Lange \"illegally\" ended the convention despite motions for a recount.",
      "",
      "Lange who said she was forced to take a security detail to even go to the bathroom during the convention said police and Caesars Entertainment hotel officials told her that the convention had to be immediately adjourned due to ongoing security details.",

      "\"Without adequate security personnel, and in consultation with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and event organizers, a decision was made that it was in the best interest of everyone in attendance to end the event,\" Forkis said in a statement.",
      "Secondly, an ongoing debate has emerged post-convention over questions of violence and allegations of chair-throwing from Sanders supporters.",
      "There's no clear evidence of a chair being thrown, but the post-adjournment attitude was tense with Sanders delegates screaming obscenities and pushing back barriers between the crowd and the main stage.",

      "Despite being dead for 49 years, Margaret Sanger, founder of the organization that became Planned Parenthood, has a way of turning up in the news. Her latest appearance came during remarks by Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson at a retirement center in Exeter, N.H.",
      "Answering a question at RiverWoods Retirement Community, Carson said that \"Planned Parenthood, as you know, was founded by Margaret Sanger. . . . Margaret Sanger was a eugenicist. She believed that people like me should be eliminated, or kept under control.\"",
      "At a press conference later, he specified what he meant by \"people like me.\" He said he was \"talking about the black race.\"",
      "Claims like this have been examined by PolitiFact before. Back in March, New Hampshire Rep. William O'Brien claimed Sanger was an \"an active participant in the Ku Klux Klan.\" That claim was rated false.",
      "And in 2011, businessman and GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain said Planned Parenthood's early mission was to \"help kill black babies before they came into the world.\" That statement was rated Pants on Fire.",
      "Carson's statement pulls on the same threads.",
      "Sanger was indeed a believer in eugenics, but the basic concept that humanity could be improved by selective breeding was an article of faith for many in the years before World War II. Winston Churchill, Herbert Hoover, Theodore Roosevelt, George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells all supported the movement. African-American leader W. E. B. Du Bois backed many of its principles as well.",
      "Although the eugenics movement included some who had racist ideas, wanting to create some sort of master race, \"only a minority of eugenicists\" ever believed this, according to Ruth Engs, professor emerita at the Indiana University School of Public Health and an expert in the movement.",
      "At the time that Sanger was active, Engs wrote, \"the purpose of eugenics was to improve the human race by having people be more healthy through exercise, recreation in parks, marriage to someone free from sexually transmitted diseases, well-baby clinics, immunizations, clean food and water, proper nutrition, non-smoking and drinking.\"",
      "It's a far cry to equate eugenics with advocating the elimination of black people.",
      "For Sanger, her ideas were a matter a public health. As late as 1957, she put her views this way in an interview with Mike Wallace: \"I think the greatest sin in the world is bringing children into the world -- that have disease from their parents, that have no chance in the world to be a human being practically. Delinquents, prisoners, all sorts of things just marked when they're born. That to me is the greatest sin -- that people can -- can commit.\"",
      "Sanger was indeed a birth control activist, which means that she wanted women to be able to avoid unwanted pregnancies. She worked for women of all classes and races to have that choice, which she believed to be a right.",
      "Quoted in an article about the false accusation that Sanger supported the Ku Klux Klan (she merely addressed a women's auxiliary and later compared them to children because of their mental simplicity), Jean H. Baker, author of Margaret Sanger: A Life of Passion, said Sanger actually opposed prejudice.",
      "Sanger \"was far ahead of her times in terms of opposing racial segregation,\" wrote Baker, a history professor at Goucher College, in an email. She worked closely with black leaders to open birth control clinics in Harlem and elsewhere.\"",
      "Even authors who treat Sanger critically don't believe she held negative views about African-Americans. Edwin Black wrote a comprehensive history of the eugenics movement, War Against the Weak, and is no fan of the activist's beliefs. Ultimately, though, he writes, \"Sanger was no racist. Nor was she anti-Semitic.\"",
      "It's also worth noting that Sanger died in 1966, six years before the Supreme Court established a nationwide right to abortion services in Roe v. Wade.",
      "Those who point a finger at Sanger as a racist often cite a particular statement in claiming she harbored ill will toward black people. In a Dec. 10, 1939, letter, she wrote that \"We don't want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs.\"",
      "But PolitFact Georgia debunked those who would read the statement as something sinister.",
      "\"Sanger's correspondence shows this sentence advocates for black doctors and ministers to play leadership roles in the Negro Project to avoid misunderstandings. Lynchings and Jim Crow laws gave blacks good reason to be wary of attempts to limit the number of children they bore. In Harlem, she hired a black doctor and social worker to quell those fears,\" the article says.",

      "As Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan traded barbs in their last debate before Tuesday's election, the subject once again turned to the rising cost of higher education.",
      "Ayotte was asked why she had voted for \"budget bills\" that would have cut money for Pell Grants, the federal subsidy for needy undergraduates. \"That's just not true,\" she said.",
      "Ayotte said she voted to make \"sure there was annual oversight over the spending of Pell Grants.\"",
      "A little later, Hassan, who is running to unseat Ayotte, encouraged people to \"check for themselves\" regarding Ayotte's votes.",
      "\"On March 27, 2015, she voted for a budget that had $90 billion of cuts to Pell Grants. The day before, she voted against an amendment to that budget that would have restored that $90 billion,\" Hassan said.",
      "PolitiFact decided to check it out -- did Ayotte, who often trumpets her support of Pell Grants, in fact vote to cut funding for the program? We reached out to both campaigns, as well as a couple federal budget policy experts.",
      "Hassan's campaign pointed to Ayotte's votes on a budget resolution conference agreement in 2015 -- in the Congressional Record, S. Con. Res. 11 -- and a proposed amendment to it.",
      "The first thing to note is that on March 27, 2015, Ayotte voted on a budget resolution -- which is a document that sets guidelines for the appropriations committees. It's not a binding spending outline and does not initiate cuts itself.",
      "\"It doesn't have the effect of law, it doesn't go to the President for signature. It's also a broad ranging document that covers a ton of issues, so you could oppose a provision but support the package,\" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense.",
      "It's a packet of suggestions -- and, crucially, vague ones at that.",
      "Budget resolutions only set \"top-line\" numbers in broad spending categories the next budget shouldn't go over. They never get so detailed as to discuss appropriations to individual programs -- including Pell Grants. And again, it's non-binding.",
      "\"You can't really say it cuts a program or it doesn't cut a program. That's pretty impossible,\" said Jason Delisle, of the American Enterprise Institute.",
      "So where did the $90 billion figure come from?",
      "Hassan's campaign pointed to remarks made by Shaun Donovan, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, who wrote on April 30, 2015, that the Republican's budget resolution \"eliminates roughly $90 billion in mandatory funding for the Pell Grant program. That would either require significant cuts in other domestic priorities to make up for lost funding or result in deep cuts to the Pell program.\"",
      "But there's something important to note about Donovan's statement. It refers to \"mandatory\" funding. If a budget resolution suggests taking away a program's \"mandatory\" spending, that still means the program can recover those funds through discretionary spending -- spending that Congress reviews every year.",
      "This is what Ayotte was referring to when she said she wanted to \"make sure there was annual oversight over the spending of Pell Grants.\"",
      "Of course, making a program's spending subject to Congressional approval each year certainly makes it more vulnerable to actual cuts -- especially if total discretionary spending targets go down by $759 billion -- because it would compete for those other dollars in a smaller pool. And that's why several higher education advocacy groups denounced the Republican budget plan. But strictly speaking, making a program's funding discretionary doesn't actually cut its spending.",
      "As noted by the Hassan campaign, Ayotte did vote against an amendment to the budget resolution, put forward by Senator Al Franken of Minnesota. According to its statement of purpose, that amendment \"(restored) the $89,000,000,000 in cuts to Federal Pell Grants in the Republican budget.\" Republicans, who objected to the assumption their budget resolution would cut Pell Grants, universally voted against it, and Democrats universally voted for it.",
      "But Delisle also notes that while statement of purpose for Franken's amendment made explicit mention of Pell Grants, the text of the amendment itself didn't. Instead, it simply noted top-line budget categories in the resolution and increased the amount assigned to them.",
      "In short, the amendment made the assumption that by reducing or increasingly certain overall top-line spending targets, a certain amount would or wouldn't trickle down to Pell Grants. But it didn't actually point to a spot in the budget resolution where a certain amount of money was allocated to Pell Grants and assign more dollars to the program -- because that spot doesn't exist.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Maggie Hassan says Kelly Ayotte \"voted for a budget that had $90 billion of cuts to Pell Grants. The day before, she voted against an amendment to that budget that would have restored that $90 billion.\"",
      "What Ayotte voted on was a budget resolution, a broad outline for spending, which is non-specific and non-binding. It's not the same as a vote for an actual budget, which dictates federal spending.",
      "Moreover, the resolution didn't call for a cut to Pell Grants. It made the spending discretionary, rather than mandatory. The change would have made the grants more vulnerable, but it's not the same as a cut .",

    "body-text": [
      "UPDATE: A more recent version of a similar claim is available here.",
      "When it comes to increasing the national debt, President Barack Obama has done more than his 43 predecessors combined. Well, at least that's according to a chain e-mail circulating in New Jersey, echoing a claim made to varying degrees by different Republican officials in recent years. With the subject line \"A picture is worth 1,000 words,\" the chain e-mail features a graphic to make its case. Above pictures of Presidents George Washington and George W. Bush, one side of the graphic reads \"Debt Added By The Previous 43 U.S. PRESIDENTS COMBINED --- 1789 through 2008.\" Beneath the presidents' photos is \"$6.3 TRILLION DOLLARS.\" On the other side of the graphic is a photo of a smiling Obama, beneath the words \"Debt Added By PRESIDENT OBAMA --- One Term!\" The amount listed below the photo is \"$6.5 TRILLION DOLLARS.\" A picture may be worth 1,000 words, but the wording of this chain e-mail makes for a largely inaccurate claim. The main problem is the chain e-mail suggests that Obama already has \"added\" $6.5 trillion to the national debt. His administration is on track to add nearly that amount to one form of debt by October 2013, but the president has not added that much debt yet. First, let's explain the two commonly cited forms of national debt -- debt held by the public and total debt. The debt held by the public refers to money borrowed from investors outside of the federal government. The total debt represents debt held by the public as well as money the federal government owes itself, including for programs such as Social Security and Medicare.",
      "On Jan. 20, 2009, the date of Obama's inauguration, the debt held by the public -- as accrued by Obama's predecessors -- stood at roughly $6.307 trillion and the total debt was about $10.6 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury's \"Debt to the Penny\" calculator.",
      "Since the amount listed for Obama's predecessors in the chain e-mail appears to be in reference to the $6.307 trillion in debt held by the public on Jan. 20, 2009, that's the starting point for our analysis.",
      "Next, we'll show how much both forms of debt had increased as of April 27, 2012 -- the last date available at the time we received the chain e-mail. By that date, the debt held by the public was about $10.8 trillion and total debt had climbed to roughly $15.6 trillion. So, under Obama's watch, debt held by the public had increased by about $4.5 trillion, or roughly 72 percent. Total debt had increased by nearly $5 trillion, or about 47 percent. By either form of debt, the amounts added during Obama's administration were not greater than the levels on the day he took office. Now, let's explain one way that this chain e-mail could be considered accurate. If we take into account administration projections for debt held by the public as of the end of fiscal year 2013, then the amount of that debt added would exceed the level from Jan. 20, 2009. Fiscal year 2013 is the last budget year to begin during Obama's first term. According to the White House's Office of Management and Budget, debt held by the public is estimated to be about $12.636 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2013, which concludes Sept. 30, 2013. Based on that estimate, the amount of debt held by the public that was added during Obama's tenure would be about $6.329 trillion, surpassing the amount as of his inauguration by about $22 billion. In terms of total debt -- projected to increase to $17.5 trillion -- the amount added by the end of fiscal year 2013 would still not exceed the total amount on Jan. 20, 2009.",
      "Before we get to our ruling, it's worth noting that actions taken by both Presidents Bush and Obama have contributed to the debt increases over the last decade. Those factors include tax cuts enacted under Bush and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, both of which were started by the Bush administration, as well as the stimulus bill and another tax cut deal approved by Obama.",
      "Experts also have pointed to the weak economy as a contributing factor to the higher debt, given the reduction in federal revenues and greater spending on items like unemployment benefits. Our ruling A chain e-mail circulating in New Jersey claims that Obama has \"added\" $6.5 trillion to the national debt, while his 43 predecessors added $6.3 trillion combined. But the chain e-mail is wrong to suggest the additional debt during Obama's tenure already has exceeded the level of his predecessors. In terms of both debt held by the public and total debt, the Obama administration has added less debt than the amounts in place when he took office. Still, the national debt is projected to keep increasing. The amount of added debt held by the public may exceed Obama's predecessors by October 2013, according to White House projections. We rate the statement Mostly False.",

For all New Yorkers who pay local and state taxes, it's going to be very difficult, because they're going to have to pay a lot more money.\"",
      "Gillibrand made the claim before Republicans released their final tax bill, a compromise between versions passed in the House and Senate. We're basing our fact check on details that were available at the time.",
      "Was she right that middle-class earners will see higher taxes under the Republican plan?",

      "Even in states like New York, where a third of taxpayers deduct their state and local taxes from their federal tax, the new limits on those deductions are not likely to result in higher overall tax bills.",
      "Tax rates for middle-income earners will go down. Those making between about $38,000 and $70,000 will see their federal tax rate decrease from 25 percent to 22 percent, for example.",

      "Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo wants local governments to cut costs and share services to reduce burdensome property taxes for New York state residents. Cuomo unveiled a proposal in his State of the State speech for county leaders to craft an annual cost-cutting plan, which would be submitted to voters for approval.",
      "Westchester County Executive Robert P. Astorino took exception at Cuomo deflecting blame for property taxes.",
      "\"I would remind the governor that I have never once raised the county tax levy -- not for seven straight years -- while Mr. Cuomo's state mandates have ravaged county, municipal and school budgets,\" Astorino said.",
      "Has Astorino kept the tax levy flat in Westchester County since taking office?",
      "Astorino's budget",
      "Cuomo won a second term as governor in 2014 when he beat Astorino, the Republican nominee. Astorino has acknowledged he's keeping the door open to another shot at Cuomo. As county executive of Westchester County, Astorino leads a county that has among the highest property taxes in the country. When Astorino started as county executive in 2010, the county collected about $560.7 million in property taxes from residents. In his first year, Astorino approved a $12.3 million, or two percent, cut in the county's real property tax levy. Since then Westchester County's property tax levy has remained flat.",
      "So the county portion of residents' property tax bill has decreased. Instead of just keeping the tax rate flat, Astorino and the county legislature opted to keep the dollar amount of the tax levy the same. Since more residents have moved into Westchester County in the past seven years, the property tax levy - now $548 million annually - has been spread out among more taxpayers.",
      "\"With the tax levy frozen, county property taxes for residents in Westchester have actually gone down,\" said Ken Girardin of the Empire Center, an independent, non-partisan and non-profit think tank in Albany.",
      "That does not necessarily mean a resident's total property tax bill is lower. Their bill is comprised of county and local taxes, including school taxes.",
      "The sales tax rate in Westchester County has been 3 percent since 2004, according to the state Dept. of Taxation and Finance. Yonkers, the largest city in the county, was allowed by the legislature to raise its local sales tax in 2015. That decision was made by the city council and approved by the state legislature, not the county.",
      "The few other taxes the county collects, like the hotel occupancy tax, have also stayed at the same rate since Astorino was elected, the county's press office says. Revenue from these taxes has increased since Astorino took office.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Astorino said \"I have never once raised the county tax levy -- not for seven straight years.\"",
      "He's right, according to the county's budget department and the New York State Comptroller's Office. He has proposed seven budgets, all of which either kept the tax levy flat or lowered it.",

      "\"It's completely focused on the wealthy and the powerful - not the middle class,\" Schumer said on CBS' Face the Nation.",
      "The plan's framework is big on policy but scarce on details. So is Schumer right? Given the proposed changes to tax rates, brackets, deductions and tax credits, does the Trump plan focus only on the nation's wealthiest taxpayers?",
      "The tax rates",
      "Trump's tax plan would increase the lowest federal tax rate, but it also would increase the number of people who don't have to pay federal income tax.",
      "The lowest earners currently have a federal income tax rate of 10 percent. Those are single filers who earn up to $9,325 and married couples who earn up to $18,650 in 2017.",
      "Trump's tax plan would increase the lowest rate from 10 percent to 12 percent. The White House hasn't said what income level would top out that bracket.",
      "People in the highest tax bracket would pay a lower rate. Single filers who make more than $418,400 and married filers who make more than $470,700 are currently taxed at 39.6 percent. That rate would decrease to 35 percent in Trump's tax plan.",
      "Trump leaves open the possibility of adding a fourth tax bracket for the highest earners. Adding another bracket means the new tax code \"does not shift the tax burden from high income to lower and middle income taxpayers,\" according to the plan. Details on what that bracket would look like were not in the plan.",
      "RELATED: Are Republicans paying for tax cuts with reductions in Medicare, Medicaid?",
      "The deductions",
      "More people in the lowest tax bracket would not have to pay federal income tax under Trump's plan.",
      "Most low-income filers already pay no federal income tax because their deductions are more than their reported income. Filers who make less than their total deductions do not pay federal income tax.",
      "Two major deductions benefit low-income filers the most: the standard deduction and personal exemptions.",
      "The current standard deduction is $6,350 for single filers and $12,700 for married filers. Filers can itemize their deductions rather than taking the standard deduction.",
      "Personal exemptions allow filers to deduct $4,050 for each taxpayer and dependent they claim, including themselves.",
      "The two combined equal a deduction of $10,400 for a single filer without children in 2017. The amounts change each year.",
      "Trump's plan would eliminate personal exemptions but double the standard deduction to $12,000 for single filers and $24,000 for married filers.",
      "That means any filer who earns less than those amounts would pay no federal income tax.",
      "Looked at in a different way, a single filer currently in the gap between $10,400 and $12,000 would no longer pay federal income tax.",
      "\"The framework is basically taking the current 10 percent tax rate and increasing it to 12 but at the same time it's effectively increasing the size of the zero tax bracket, at least initially,\" said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan tax policy think tank.",
      "Trump's plan would replace personal exemptions with a higher Child Tax Credit, which currently allows a $1,000 credit for each child claimed.",
      "A tax credit is different from a deduction. A credit is a dollar amount put toward a filer's total return while a deduction reduces the amount of a filer's taxable income. The Internal Revenue Service says a tax credit is always worth more than a deduction of the same amount.",
      "The new plan does not specify how much the credit would increase.",
      "Who gets the best deal?",
      "Many of the tax changes would benefit high-income earners more than others, a report from the Tax Policy Center said.",
      "Some of the proposals, like ending the alternative minimum tax and estate tax, would benefit high-income earners disproportionately.",
      "About 80 percent of the total tax benefit would go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers by 2027, the report said. Their after-tax income would increase 8.7 percent.",
      "Taxpayers who make less than about $150,000 each year would see an average tax cut of half a percent or less by 2027 under the plan. Taxpayers who make between $150,000 and $300,000 would actually pay about $800 more on average in taxes.",
      "Taxes would increase for about a quarter of all taxpayers by 2027. The report estimates about a third of people making between $50,000 and $150,000 and close to two-thirds of people making between $150,000 and $300,000 would see a tax increase.",
      "The report partly attributes those increases to Trump's plan to replace personal exemptions with a higher Child Tax Credit. Trading the deduction for a credit could leave larger low and middle income families worse off than the current tax code. That will depend on how much the Child Tax Credit increases under the Trump plan.",
      "Filers also would no longer be able to deduct state and local taxes from their federal taxes under the plan. That means residents in high tax states like New York could end up paying more in federal taxes.",
      "A report from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's office estimates 3.3 million residents in New York would on average pay $5,300 more in federal income taxes if they were not able to deduct state and local taxes.",
      "More than three million of those residents make below $300,000, according to the report. About 1.8 million make less than $100,000.",

So in a strict reading of his claim, Schumer is saying the Trump plan has no changes, positive or negative, for low- or middle-income taxpayers. That isn't the case.",
      "It's possible that by \"completely focused\" Schumer meant the Trump plan benefits only the wealthy and the powerful. But that also isn't completely true. While many of the plan's proposals would benefit the wealthy, doubling the standard deduction would mean more of the country's lowest earners would pay no federal income tax and taxpayers earning less than about $150,000 would see a tax cut.",

I just think it's overly simplistic to align a mass shooter's influence with a political ideology unless it's clear from the shooter that this was his (or her) driving issue.\"",
      "Other experts reacted similarly to the assertion that shooters tend to have common political beliefs.",
      "\"Most of the school shooters are children who wouldn't know a conservative from a communist,\" said Jack Levin, Northeastern professor and co-director of the Brudnick Center on Violence and Conflict. \"The idea of associating politics with these mass murders is absurd. It has absolutely nothing to do with it.\"",

      "In the fight to defend Charlotte's anti-discrimination ordinance, supporters questioned claims that it would have been a threat to public safety.",
      "Chris Sgro, executive director of Equality NC, said many large cities have rules similar to what Charlotte proposed, before the legislature nullified it. Equality NC has since sued North Carolina to try to overturn the law.",
      "\"There have not been any public safety issues in those other communities,\" Sgro said at a rally outside the legislature just days before Charlotte's bill was overturned.",
      "Conservatives weren't swayed, though. Before Charlotte's bill was passed, and then after when it was being debated by the General Assembly and even now that is has been overturned, concerns about safety have been frequently mentioned.",
      "Mostly, opponents said opening up women's restrooms to transgender women people who are biologically male but identify as female will make it easier for male sexual predators to commit crimes in bathrooms and locker rooms.",
      "Online, supporters galvanized around the motto #KeepNCSafe and sent out ads that included the phrase \"don't let our girls become victims\" and \"keep children safe.\"",
      "N.C. GOP Executive Director Dallas Woodhouse cited \"privacy and safety concerns\" in attacking Attorney General Roy Cooper, who is running for governor as a Democrat, for not stepping in to stop Charlotte's bill on his own.",
      "A popular Christian author from Charlotte, Frank Turek, wrote an article about the backlash to the law that included the line, \"The danger is real from sexual predators in women's restrooms.\" On Thursday, the N.C. GOP distributed his column via email and bolded that sentence about sexual predators.",
      "So who is right? The evidence is overwhelmingly on Sgro's side.",
      "That's not to say that people don't have honest concerns over privacy or mental anguish. Indeed, several opponents of Charlotte's ordinance have spoken of their own experiences with sexual assault, and their fears that seeing someone with male genitalia in a women's room might trigger painful memories.",
      "But still, Sgro said, Charlotte's bill would not have legalized sexual assault, harassment or voyeurism it just would've let transgender men and women use the bathrooms they're more comfortable in.",
      "\"Transgender people are not predators,\" he said.",
      "Examples to prove Sgro wrong?",
      "The entire state of Maryland and some of the largest cities in the country, including New York City, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Seattle and Austin, Texas, have rules banning discrimination against transgender people in public accommodation, including bathrooms. More than 200 cities and counties also ban workplace discrimination against transgender people.",
      "A dozen state public school systems and dozens of college campuses also have ordinances banning discrimination against transgender people, including in bathrooms.",
      "We asked the N.C. GOP if they could point to anything that backs up the safety fears. They provided a link to a news story in Seattle from earlier this year, about a man who had twice gone into a women's locker room and began undressing. Seattle does allow transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as.",
      "The man didn't identify as transgender and didn't appear to present as a woman, the story said. No one called the police, and the man wasn't charged with any crime. Follow-up stories described the incident as a stunt, perhaps politically motivated.",
      "The liberal group Media Matters For America has studied the bathroom issue for several years, largely under the guidance of Carlos Maza.",
      "Maza, a Wake Forest University graduate, tweeted after North Carolina's new law passed that \"A man has never used an LGBT non-discrimination law to sneak into a bathroom.\"",
      "Maza has also polled public school systems that allow transgender students to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as. In a June 2015 article, he wrote that in 17 districts with a total of 600,00 students, officials hadn't reported a single incident of \"harassment or inappropriate behavior\" related to transgender students and bathrooms.",
      "But we still weren't satisfied, so we kept digging, looking for examples of proven criminal behavior. We were likewise unable to find any examples in the United States, though we did find a case in Canada.",
      "In that case, Christopher Hambrook posed as a woman to gain entry to women's shelters, where he attacked several people before being caught. Hambrook was sentenced to an \"indefinite\" jail term in 2014 that could lead to him spending the rest of his life in prison.",
      "Hambrook committed the crimes in Toronto, which has an ordinance protecting transgender people. That appears to be the first, and so far only, incident of its kind in North America.",
      "After spending hours combing through conservative blogs and family values websites dedicated to news about transgender bathroom ordinances, we were able to confirm three cases in the United States in the last 17 years in which a biological male was convicted of a crime that involved him in a women's bathroom or locker room and dressed as a woman.",
      "It's unclear if any of the three identified as transgender women, but none of those cases happened in cities where it would've been legal for a transgender woman to use the women's room anyway. And none involved sexual assault or rape.",
      "In 1999, Patrick Hagan was convicted in Tampa, Fla., for punching a woman in a bar bathroom during an argument. In 2010, Norwood Burns was convicted in Gordon County, Georgia, for exposing himself in a Walmart bathroom. In 2011, Thomas Lee Benson was convicted of trespassing in a Clackamas, Oregon, women's locker room and trying to talk to children.",
      "Again, though, none of those crimes occurred in places where biological men would've had any legal claim to being in a women's room by virtue of being a transgender woman.",
      "The blogs did identify a few examples of alleged criminal activity having taken place under the guise of transgender-friendly bathrooms laws, but we couldn't find proof of any convictions in those cases.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Chris Sgro, the executive director of Equality NC, said that \"There have not been any public safety issues in those other communities\" with ordinances allowing transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice.",
      "We haven't found any instances of criminals convicted of using transgender protections as cover in the United States. Neither have any left-wing groups or right-wing groups.",

      "They say the third time's the charm.",
      "For Donald Trump, his third claim about a historic showing in the GOP primary finally hit the mark. First, he jumped the gun. Next, he exaggerated his margin of victory. But in a speech in Raleigh on July 5, Trump accurately described his historic accomplishment.",
      "\"We got the highest vote count in the history of the Republican Party,\" he said, speaking just of the primary elections since, of course, the general election hasn't happened yet.",
      "How did Trump avoid some of the pitfalls he has made in the past with this unexpectedly tricky claim?",
      "In April, he claimed he had received the most votes of any Republican nominee ever.",
      "PolitiFact rated that False, because he had not received the most votes ever. However, as the article noted, Trump did have the chance to reach that milestone with strong showings in some upcoming primaries.",
      "Then on June 1, Trump said he had broken the record by millions of votes. PolitiFact rated that statement False as well. Trump had finally broken the record, but only by a small amount.",
      "\"Had Trump made a correct claim in one breath only to mangle the truth in the next?\" we asked.",
      "Yes, he had.",
      "But he finally got it right by avoiding any embellishment, and just sticking to the claim of a record-breaking victory.",
      "According to Real Clear Politics, Trump received about 13.3 million votes during the primary. That's about 1.8 million votes more than the previous record, held by George W. Bush.",
      "Basking in the record",
      "On Tuesday, Trump spoke about winning in face of a crowded primary field and a \"rigged system,\" then name-dropped some GOP elders whose vote totals he eclipsed.",
      "\"Not only did the Republican party go way up from what it was four years ago way, way up but Donald Trump, in the history of the primary system, Republican Party, with 17 people running a lot of people don't understand, when you say 17 people I got almost 14 million votes,\" Trump said. \"More than anybody in the history of the Republican Party. More than Ronald Reagan. More than the Bushes. More than Richard Nixon. More than Dwight D. Eisenhower, who did win the second World War; it certainly helped a heck of a lot.\"",
      "\"We got the highest vote count in the history of the Republican Party,\" he continued. \"It was such a big thing for me. We won 37 states. We got stronger and stronger and stronger.\"",
      "A less dubious record",
      "But does his record mean that Trump is the most popular Republican candidate ever?",
      "No.",
      "What Trump didn't mention was that during this primary, most Republican voters cast a ballot for someone other than him. More than 16 million people cast votes for another candidate, according to a Washington Post analysis.",
      "To be fair, Trump was facing a crowded primary field, which he mentioned in his speech.",
      "But 13 of his 16 challengers didn't make much of a splash. The top three challengers, however Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Marco Rubio, in that order combined to receive more than 15 million votes.",
      "So Trump now holds two GOP primary records: most votes for, and most votes against. Previously, John McCain was the holder of the most-votes-against record.",
      "As the national convention approaches, it's also worth noting that Trump isn't the only GOP frontrunner to have received less than half of his party's votes in the primary, but he is one of just a few. The nomination results in past cases have been a mixed bag.",
      "McCain won the nomination in 2008 despite receiving less than half the votes, as did Barry Goldwater in 1964. But the frontrunners in 1968 (Ronald Reagan) and 1952 (Robert Taft) went into the convention with less than 50 percent of the primary votes and ended up losing the nomination.",
      "Finally, it's worth noting that some historical comparisons of vote totals and percentages are hardly apples-to-apples. The current primary system is a relatively new process.",
      "As one political scientist previously told PolitiFact, \"Before the 1970s, candidates often did not run in many primaries and caucuses to win delegates\" because party leaders had more influence than they do now, and national conventions were typically contested no matter what.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said he got the most votes in the history of the Republican Party primary system.",
      "That's accurate. He received 13.3 million votes, beating George W. Bush's record of 11.5 million votes.",
      "Yet what Trump failed to mention is that he also holds the record for the most votes cast against a primary candidate, and that he's one of only a few Republican frontrunners in modern history to have been supported by less than half of the party's primary voters.",
      "Because Trump's claim was accurate but missing that context, we rate this claim Mostly True.",

Well, I think anyone who is willing to work hard should be able to find a job that pays well enough to raise a family. So we're going to increase the federal minimum wage and give the middle class a raise.\"",

      "As it turns out, Trump's views on wages are all over the map. He did say at one Republican presidential debate that he thought wages are too high, but he has also later said that he doesn't understand how people survive on the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.",
      "PolitiFact has previously noted his scattered opinions on wages, in an article devoted to tracking his evolving positions on a half dozen topics.",
      "So we'll look instead at the second part of Clinton's attack. Did Trump really say the he wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage?",
      "Like his other comments on wages in general, Trump's stance on the federal minimum wage is a bit complicated to parse.",
      "In May, he appeared on NBC's Meet The Press, when host Chuck Todd attempted to pin him down on this very subject.",
      "Trump began by expressing sympathy for people working for the minimum wage, saying \"I have seen what's going on. And I don't know how people make it on $7.25 an hour.\"",
      "He immediately pivoted, saying that while he would personally like to see a higher minimum wage, he also wouldn't do anything if elected to make it reality.",
      "\"I would like to see an increase of some magnitude,\" Trump told Todd. \"But I'd rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Because don't forget, the states have to compete with each other.\"",
      "Todd followed that up by asking if Trump thought the states should only be able to decide whether to raise their minimum wages from the $7.25 federally mandated minimum wage, or if there should be no federal minimum wage at all giving states the option to go lower than $7.25 or have no minimum wage at all.",
      "\"But should the federal government set a floor?\" Todd asked.",
      "\"No,\" Trump replied. \"I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do.\"",

      "But is it true?",
      "The Twitter user who started the viral rumors didn't respond to our requests for comment. After spending some of Wednesday retweeting news that her post was trending internationally, she later deleted her account.",
      "Trump was endorsed by the KKK's official newspaper. And after his victory became official Wednesday morning, former KKK Imperial Wizard David Duke tweeted: \"This is one of the most exciting nights of my life. Make no mistake about it, our people have played a HUGE role in electing Trump!\"",
      "However, there's no proof that the Klan was on the march in North Carolina, like the viral post claimed.",
      "The photo appears to show a group of Trump supporters that local media also interviewed.",
      "And according to that news report and follow-up interviews, none of them were wearing KKK regalia, carrying Confederate flags or doing anything else that would link them to the racist group.",
      "The scene on the bridge",
      "Although the tweet claimed the marchers were on the bridge in Mebane Wednesday morning, they were actually there on Tuesday afternoon and night.",
      "Natalie Allison Janicello, a reporter for the local Burlington Times-News, was there interviewing them. She said she's sure the group in the viral post is the same group she spoke with; she could recognize the same flags and the neon yellow shirt of someone in the photo.",
      "None of them were wearing any KKK regalia, she said, or carrying flags associated with the Confederacy or white supremacy movements. Instead, they had Trump signs, red-white-and-blue scarves and an assortment of American, Christian and \"Don't Tread On Me\" flags.",
      "\"There was no one claiming or professing to be part of the KKK,\" Janicello said. \"These were just local conservatives who were out there for Trump.\"",
      "Janicello said they had actually come to that spot a few times a month, since February, to wave flags to passing traffic.",
      "Furthermore, neither the Mebane Police Department nor the Alamance County Sheriff's Office received complaints of KKK activity close to the election either at that bridge or anywhere else in the area. The sheriff's office said in a press release Wednesday that calls only started coming in after the photo went viral, and that there's nothing to substantiate the rumors.",
      "\"Several members of law enforcement had observed these individuals over the past weeks, and never observed any paraphernalia related to the KKK nor Confederate symbols,\" the press release said. \"No suspicious activity was observed nor reported.\"",
      "The newspaper's photos from the bridge show that some of the marchers were affiliated with the group Alamance County Taking Back Alamance County (ACTBAC). It received some notoriety this summer when it began raising money to buy and install Confederate flags along Interstate 40, which is the busiest road in a number of North Carolina counties.",
      "But there were no Confederate flags or KKK regalia visible at the Trump celebration, Janicello said. She also interviewed an Alamance County Republican Party official at the bridge, but party leaders later told us there was no formal connection.",
      "\"I haven't even heard of what you're talking about,\" said Ben York, the Alamance County Republican Party chairman, several hours after the image had gone viral.",
      "The KKK in North Carolina",
      "Despite there being no proof behind the viral claim, Alamance County was one of the major early hotbeds of KKK activity in North Carolina.",
      "In an 1870 incident known as the Kirk-Holden War, a band of Klan supporters from Alamance and Caswell counties attempted to capture the town of Pittsboro in neighboring Chatham County. They were defeated by a militia formed by Gov. William Holden, who also arrested some prominent Klan supporters. That infuriated white supremacist state lawmakers, who soon made Holden the first governor in U.S. history to be impeached and removed from office. Holden was pardoned by the N.C. Senate in 2011.",
      "The contemporary KKK has also found support in the central area of the state, called the Piedmont, which includes Alamance County.",
      "\"In North Carolina, one of its banner states, the modern Klan thrived among mill workers and other blue-collar laborers in the Piedmont,\" according to the 2006 book Encyclopedia of North Carolina.",
      "Our ruling",
      "A viral post on social media claimed to show KKK members marching in Mebane, N.C. on Wednesday morning after Trump won the election.",
      "Trump has been supported by the KKK, and that area of North Carolina does have longstanding ties to KKK activity. But thanks to a newspaper reporter who was at the scene, and whose reporting was corroborated by local law enforcement, we know that there's no substance to the rumors.",
      "The people were not wearing KKK regalia and didn't even have a Confederate flag amongst them. They also were never overheard saying anything about the KKK they were simply excited for Trump.",
      "We rate this claim False.",

      "After Gov. Roy Cooper introduced a proposal repealing House Bill 2, one of the law's biggest supporters spoke up.",
      "Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Forest who has already announced he wants to run for governor in 2020 said Cooper's strategy to repeal HB2 \"will risk the safety of our people to achieve a radical social policy agenda.\"",
      "HB2 said people can only use the bathrooms of their birth gender (not their gender identity), and it banned cities and counties around North Carolina from creating rules related to bathroom access or discrimination protections for LGBT people, or raising the minimum wage.",
      "We previously found that there's no real history of safety problems associated with transgender-friendly bathroom rules. However, Forest's claim doubled down on such concerns.",
      "\"If Governor Cooper's proposed bill for repealing HB2 becomes law, it will create a state-sanctioned 'Look But Don't Touch' policy in our bathrooms,\" Forest said in a written statement. \"Heterosexual men will be able to access women's showers and bathrooms by simply posing as a transgender individual. They will be able to watch women and children shower, or shower next to them. As long as the man doesn't touch them, assault them or film them, no legal protection would be afforded the offended woman or child. Nothing.\"",
      "That's a shocking claim. We found it's also not based in reality.",
      "What happens if HB2 gets repealed",
      "We should note one thing right off the bat: Forest issued his statement on Cooper's bill before the bill was filed, basing his claim simply off what Cooper said in a press conference.",
      "That means we won't use the bill itself to examine Forest's claim. Instead, we'll use the facts that existed at the time including that Cooper had proposed repealing HB2 and strengthening criminal penalties for certain crimes committed in bathrooms.",
      "His statement implies Cooper proposed letting transgender people use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify. That's not true. In reality, Cooper suggested a return to the status quo that North Carolina used for centuries, in which there were no laws about bathroom access.",
      "We asked Forest spokesman Jamey Falkenbury if Forest thought that North Carolina had a \"state-sanctioned Look But Don't Touch' policy\" for all that time. Falkenbury said Forest was instead making the assumption that, once HB2 is repealed, cities and counties will rush to pass transgender-friendly bathroom rules.",
      "We can't see the future, and neither can Forest, although Falkenbury did correctly point out that \"with HB2 repealed there would be no legal mechanism to block those ordinances.\"",
      "Yet even if that did happen the decision is up to local governments, and the rules would only apply locally. That's hardly a \"state-sanctioned\" policy, contrary to Forest's claim.",
      "Law enforcement doesn't lack power",
      "We looked into legal protections for two different possibilities: What powers law enforcement will have under the situation Cooper actually proposed, as well as under the situation Forest believes might happen.",
      "That first one is easy.",
      "There are a number of laws the state can use to protect people from the kinds of acts Forest described. There might be more, but at least six could apply: Trespassing, stalking, breaking and entering, indecent exposure, secret peeping and sex offender restrictions.",
      "And since HB2 contains no civil or criminal penalties for violations, repealing it wouldn't take away any legal protections.",
      "If the sexual predators in Forest's scenarios are also convicted sex offenders, the state has laws to give them additional punishments for re-offending, or even for simply being near places kids go including pools, schools and other places with the kind of shared facilities Forest is worried about.",
      "And in 2015, before HB2 passed, UNC-Chapel Hill law professor Jeff Welty wrote about what could happen to people go into the wrong bathroom. Welty said there's \"a strong argument\" for trespassing and \"a reasonable argument\" for breaking and entering.",
      "He also cited a 2008 trial in which a 15-year-old boy in Greenville was convicted of trespassing for barging into his school's girls' locker room. The boy was also charged with secret peeping but wasn't convicted, as he was anything but secretive in causing a scene.",
      "So all that debunks one of Forest's concerns, of a man watching women undress with no legal consequences if HB2 is repealed. There absolutely would be legal protections. And Forest's more extreme scenario, of men being able to undress or shower with women, is even more ludicrous. North Carolina's indecent exposure law would apply, and would lead to felony charges if children were present.",
      "Trying to see the future",
      "But what about if a city took advantage of the HB2 repeal and allowed transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify? Let's examine the possibilities.",
      "We began by asking why Forest ignored Cooper's proposal for stronger penalties for bathroom crimes. That was intended as an olive branch to Republicans; it also caused the liberal, pro-LGBT groups Human Rights Campaign and Equality NC to oppose Cooper's proposal.",
      "Falkenbury said it's because Forest believes those laws would become meaningless. If a man claimed he was feeling like a woman at that particular moment in time, Falkenbury said, the law would be powerless to stop him.",
      "Again, we should point out Cooper never proposed allowing transgender people into restrooms based on their gender identity and he has refused to publicly support other Democrats' proposals to do so but we'll look into it anyway.",
      "Forest can't possibly have any North Carolina-specific proof, since nowhere in the state has ever had transgender-friendly bathroom rules (Charlotte tried to, but HB2 became law first).",
      "But Falkenbury did point to an incident in Seattle, which does have transgender-friendly bathroom rules, in which a man walked into a women's locker room at a pool. People complained, and he was kicked out of the locker room by pool staff despite claiming he had the right to be there.",
      "But that example actually goes against Forest's point, since the man was removed. And the Washington Human Rights Commission, a part of the state government, reaffirmed the decision to kick him out.",
      "\"If a business has a reasonable belief that a person is in the wrong place, there is no rule that states that the person cannot be questioned and required to leave,\" the commission said.",
      "The man in that situation was never charged with any crimes, but neither we nor Forest can say what might happen in a similar case in North Carolina. There's simply no precedent here.",
      "But Forest's more worrisome scenario, in which a man undresses or showers with women consequence-free, is clearly implausible. Even in a hypothetical North Carolina city with a transgender-friendly bathroom rule, that would absolutely be illegal.",
      "The state law against indecent exposure gives only one exception: If the nudity occurs someplace where it's incidental (like a locker room) and it happens in front of only people of the same sex. Since local ordinances can't override state law, no city's bathroom rules could change that fact. The law only cares about anatomy, not gender identity.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Lt. Gov. Dan Forest said that Cooper's HB2 repeal bill, if it passes, \"will create a state-sanctioned 'Look But Don't Touch' policy in our bathrooms\" with no laws in place to protect women from predatory men.",
      "In reality, there are at least half a dozen laws protecting people from the type of scenarios Forest wrongly said would become consequence-free. Cooper even suggested creating stronger penalties for some of them.",
      "Forest defended his claim by saying cities would start letting transgender people in bathrooms of the gender with which they identify. That's not what Cooper proposed, however. And even if it does happen, it's a local government decision, not a \"state-sanctioned\" policy. And even in that case, one of Forest's hypothetical concerns is clearly baseless, and the other is unclear at best.",

      "North Carolina teachers have been among the lowest-paid in the nation for the better part of a decade now. Concerns over education funding have dogged Republican politicians since they took over the state legislature in 2011.",
      "Pushing back against the criticism, N.C. House Speaker Tim Moore said he and his fellow Republicans are doing more to give teachers raises than politicians anywhere else in the country.",
      "\"North Carolina's teacher income is rising faster than any other state,\" Moore wrote on Twitter, Facebook and in a press release earlier this month.",
      "Teacher pay debates can quickly become controversial. Local school boards are the largest employers in many of the state's 100 counties, and the liberal N.C. Association of Educators, a teacher advocacy group, holds a great deal of political clout.",
      "When campaigning in North Carolina, politicians on both sides of the aisle tend to exaggerate claims about teacher pay. See our fact-checks of Mostly False claims by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and North Carolina's Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper for just a few examples.",
      "Now, similar to those two claims from Democratic politicians, this time Moore takes a snippet of truth and twists it out of context to try to bolster his own party.",
      "Figuring out what years to measure",
      "It wasn't immediately clear what Moore meant by \"is rising faster.\" We asked if he was talking about just the most recent school year, or the entire time Republicans have been in charge of the state budget.",
      "Moore's communications director Joseph Kyzer said it was neither. Moore was talking about the period from 2014 to 2016, Kyzer said.",
      "While none of Moore's statements ever directly gave that time frame, his press release and website did cite several blog posts and news articles about teacher pay raises in those years.",
      "\"The 2014-16 time period provided in the data the Speaker linked to covers the total teacher raises (under) Republican leadership, so it is accurate to quantify Republican pay increases over that combined period and claim NC ranks No. 1 in the U.S.,\" Kyzer said.",
      "So we looked at that time frame. But we didn't stop there, because doing so would ignore half the budgets written and passed by Moore and his colleagues.",
      "Furthermore, when the N.C. GOP shared Moore's claim in its own press release, it used the more sweeping headline \"Teacher Pay in NC Under Republican Leadership\" and never mentioned Moore's timeframe.",
      "So we looked at the years Moore's office suggested, as well as how North Carolina has done under all six years the GOP has had control of the state budget.",
      "Year-by-year",
      "In the current 2016-17 school year, the average North Carolina teacher is making just shy of $50,000. That's about a 3.9 percent raise since last year.",
      "We don't know if that's the best in the country. There's no national data yet. But it is well above the national average for the post-recession years, which has typically been below 1.5 percent.",
      "The national data for 2015-2016 is partially complete. The National Education Association, the country's largest teacher's union, aggregates this type of data for all 50 states and the District of Columbia.",
      "NEA researcher Tim Tang said nearly half haven't reported their 2015-2016 numbers year, so the data listed for them in that year's NEA reports is instead an inflation-based placeholder, But North Carolina is one of the 27 states we do have data for, and we don't need the rest to know it didn't have the nation's fastest-rising pay in 2015-2016. The state's 0.35 percent raise was higher than eight but lower than another 18. So once the other 24 report, North Carolina will rank somewhere between 19th and 43rd.",
      "The previous year, in 2014-2015 North Carolina did have the country's biggest raise, at 6.2 percent.",
      "But in 2011-2012, 2012-2013 and 2013-2014, the average North Carolina teacher's pay dropped each year. The state's change in pay ranked 47th or 48th all three years.",
      "So we crunched the numbers to see if that one excellent year could make up for the rest.",
      "Total during GOP control",
      "Moore's claim clearly isn't true if you consider the GOP's entire record.",
      "Between 2011-2012 and 2015-2016, teacher pay increased in North Carolina by 4.5 percent. Of the 27 states that have reported for 2015-16, 10 had larger increases.",
      "And between 2011-2012 and 2014-15, when we have data from all 50 states and D.C., 21 others had larger increases than in North Carolina.",
      "Teacher pay in North Carolina rose 4.1 percent in that period. The national average was 3.6 percent and the top state, Vermont, saw teacher pay rise by 12.3 percent triple the North Carolina rate.",
      "Moore's chosen timeline",
      "If we consider only Moore's cherry-picked data from 2014 on, North Carolina does appear (at least at first glance) to have the country's fastest-growing teacher pay. In those years, North Carolina's teacher pay rose 6.7 percent.",
      "But that's an arbitrary selection of years that only counts years of positive growth and excludes the years when salaries actually fell. PolitiFact previously dinged President Barack Obama for similarly cherry-picking data to warp the facts, in a Half True claim about job creation.",
      "And again, we should note that we still don't have data from 24 of the 51 states and D.C. from the 2015-16 school year. So that means while North Carolina does appear to have the fastest-rising teacher pay, 24 others could possibly surpass it.",
      "More realistically, though, five of the 24 have a reasonable chance of doing so. They are North Dakota, New Hampshire, Hawaii, Florida and the District of Columbia. Each gave about a 2 or 3 percent raise in 2013-14 and again in 2014-15. If they kept up that trend in 2015-16, they might have already surpassed North Carolina. It's simply too soon to know.",
      "Our ruling",
      "North Carolina Republican Rep. Tim Moore, the N.C. House Speaker, said that \"North Carolina's teacher income is rising faster than any other state.\"",
      "If you look at all six years Moore and his fellow Republicans have been in charge of the state budget, the claim is clearly not true. Teacher pay has risen faster in many other states.",
      "Moore said he was only counting from 2014 onward, which excludes the years teacher pay fell under GOP leadership. We frown on cherry-picking data like that. However, that data does support Moore's claim but only with the caveat that the data is incomplete, and some states could still feasibly overtake North Carolina. Either way, Moore has a point that the teacher pay is rising quickly in recent years.",

      "Gary Sick, a scholar at Columbia University's Middle East Institute, told PolitiFact at the time that the chant \"is shouted every Friday at the weekly prayer services held across Iran.\" In fact, experts say some Iranians have been chanting \"Death to America\" in Friday prayers for decades, dating back to the Iran hostage crisis in 1979.",
      "As recently as August, the Associated Press reported that members of Iranian parliament chanted it when they voted to increase spending on the country's ballistic missile program and the foreign operations of its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.",

      "Interpreting chants",

      "Kevan Harris, assistant professor at UCLA and author of a book on Iranian politics, agreed: \"To me and I've been to the revolution day' parades in Tehran as well as the Friday prayers in University of Tehran where the main political sermoning is given it is political theater.\"",
      "Harris compared it to Trump's claims in August that he'll unleash \"fire and fury\" against North Korea if it continued to threaten the United States. Harris said there are \"lots of Iranian politicians\" who are moderates that favor diplomacy.

If he's artificially manipulating Kasich's campaign in the name of other people, just look at the list of donors and explain all these other companies that have given more.\"",

Scott Bessent is a former chief investment officer for Soros Fund Management who left to start his own hedge fund company last year, with $2 billion in seed money from Soros. Campaign finance records show that he donated $200,000 to New Day for America, as well as $2,700 to Kasich directly.",
      "Bessent has donated to other conservative causes since 2015, including the Right to Rise PAC that supported Jeb Bush ($5,000) and to the Republican National Committee ($39,800). But he's donated to Democrats too; in 2013 he gave $25,000 to the Ready for Hillary PAC.",
      "Similarly, Stanley Druckenmiller, who managed assets for Soros from 1988 to 2000, gave $450,000 to New Day for America last year. If Druckenmiller shares any of Soros' political philosophies, they aren't apparent in his donor history. He has also consistently given money to Republican candidates' super PACs and the Republican National Committee.",
      "A Trusted Leadership PAC spokeswoman confirmed that Bessent and Druckenmiller are the donors that connect Soros to Kasich.",
      "According to OpenSecrets.org, which tracks campaign contributions, Soros has given $7 million this cycle to Priorities USA Action, a super PAC that supports Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. He also gave $25,000 to the pro-Clinton Ready PAC, and $1 million to American Bridge 21st Century, which funds opposition research against Republican candidates and causes.",
      "There is a \"firewall\" between candidates and the super PACs backing them, said Sutton, and while Kasich may not be happy about contributions from people connected to Soros, he can't tell them to knock it off.",
      "Candidates cannot have any contact with PACs or their donors.",
      "For these reasons, Sutton said, \"If there was a conspiracy, it's the worst conspiracy ever, because it's not working.\"",
      "He added: \"Kasich's people would love to have power at this level, because then they might be able to raise enough money to rival anything near what's going on in other campaigns.\"",

      "\"Let's run through the numbers. At the state and federal level, the United States spends more than $620 billion dollars on K-12 education each year,\" Trump said on Sept. 8, 2016. \"That's an average of about $12,296 dollars for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public schools. The federal government pays for about 10 percent of the K-12 costs. The other roughly $560 billion dollars spent on K -12 education comes from the states themselves. We spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world. And we're doing very poorly in terms of A-list.\"",
      "Back in January, Trump made a similar statement about U.S. education spending, saying we were \"No. 1 per-pupil by a factor of four.\" PolitiFact rated the statement Mostly False because it is exaggerated.",
      "This new claim is a bit more tempered.",
      "Does the United States spend more per student than other major countries?",

Their education statistics from 2012 were the most up-to-date available at the time of Trump's statement.",
      "According to the OECD, Switzerland spends the most per student at $15,500 per student, followed by Norway, and then the United States.",

      "\"It certainly is the case that we spend more than almost any country except Norway and Switzerland,\" McCluskey said. \"Very few countries outspend us in terms of absolute numbers. The United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, they all spend less than we do. I suppose you could say they're all major.\"",
      "Trump's financial figures -- $620 billion on K-12 education nationally, $12,296 per student, on average -- match the totals reported by the National Center on Education Statistics.",
      "A conclusion from the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment, a test administered to 15-year-old students in 65 countries, called out the United States for high spending and underperforming. \"While the U.S. spends more per student than most countries, this does not translate into better performance,\" it read.",
      "American students' scores on the test were mediocre. In math, American 15-year-olds ranked No. 26 out of the 34 participating countries.",
      "That concurs with Trump's assessment that \"we're doing very poorly,\" education-wise.",

      "During the 2012 legislative session, lawmakers passed a bill that requires the state's school districts to put policies in place combating teen dating violence. The legislation passed with a pretty wide margin. During the debate, statistics were thrown out left and right in support of the new policy. One in particular caught our attention. While speaking in favor of House Bill 4077, Sen. Rod Monroe, D-Portland, said \"teen dating violence is where it all starts, and where it ends is with the fact that the No. 2 cause of death in the U.S. (for) women under 50 is being killed by their spouse or domestic partner. No. 2 cause of death. Only exceeded by automobile accidents.\" There's no disputing that intimate partner violence, as it's commonly referred to in support circles, is a major problem nationally and worldwide. But could it really be the second leading cause of death for women under the age of 50? Monroe didn't have any support for his claim when we reached him at home. He mentioned that he'd heard the statistic some eight years ago at a conference in San Diego. Since then, he said, he'd read it in several articles. Without a lead, we had to start from scratch. Our first step was to check in with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has a specific division that looks into injury and violence prevention. As it happens, injury is the leading cause of death for Americans between ages 1 and 44. Gail Hayes, a spokeswoman for the Injury Center, showed us how to drill down into the data on hand. We looked for the leading causes of death for women between the ages of 1 and 50 from 1999 to 2009. This is what we found, in descending order: Malignant neoplasms (cancer), unintentional injury (largely motor vehicle accidents and poisoning), heart disease, suicide, stroke and then -- at sixth place -- homicide, which would include intimate partner violence. Unfortunately, you can't dig down any deeper into the homicide category to get a good idea of just how many of those are perpetrated by intimate partners. Even if we could have gone further, the rankings didn't seem to support Monroe. Once you remove biological causes of death -- cancer, heart attack and stroke -- homicide comes in at third place, after unintentional injuries and suicide. Hayes was kind enough to check in with some of the Injury Center scientists to see if they'd heard the statistic that Monroe cited. The best she could come up with was the fact that just over 41 percent of female homicides aged 1-50 were \"intimate-partner related.\" But, she said, that data applied to only 16 states and couldn't be reliably nationalized. The CDC had some recent reports on the issues of intimate partner violence, but none of them referenced Monroe's statistic. Our next step was a call to the National Domestic Violence Hotline. We spoke with Angela Hale who also said she hadn't heard of the statistic that we were trying to verify. We did find a similar statistic referenced in the abstract for a paper published in the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery. Ultimately, that lead never panned out. The closest we could find was a another report from 1991 that stated \"violence was the second most common cause of injury overall and the most common cause of injury of women aged 15-44.\" But violence didn't necessarily mean intimate partner violence. In fact, the only thing the article says about such violence is that 62 percent of the violent incidents involved husbands or boyfriends. Ultimately, we ended where we started: With no source to back up the claim. In the end, the onus is on the speaker to offer a source for what he said. Monroe didn't have one -- and after days of searching, we couldn't find one. There is no doubt that intimate partner violence is a serious issue, but there doesn't seem to be any evidence that it ranks as the No. 2 cause of the death for women under 50. The highest it might rank -- and even this is a stretch -- is sixth place, according to CDC data. We rate this claim False.",

      "Update 5:34 p.m.",
      "Okay. So, we're still talking about this.",
      "There's a meme circulating on the internet that promotes allegations of voter fraud in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida. Our kinsfolk over at PolitiFact National and PolitiFact Florida have already reported on claims specific to their states. For Pennsylvania, the meme reads, \"In 59 voting districts in the Philadelphia region, Obama received 100% of the votes, with not even a single vote recorded for Romney. (A mathematical and statistical impossibility.)\"",
      "This kind of happened, and it's not actually mathematically impossible. First, the 59 refers to the City of Philadelphia, not the metropolitan area or region. An absolutely crucial fact: The 59 zones that saw no votes for Romney were not districts, but divisions. There are nearly 1,700 divisions in Philadelphia. Each of the city's 66 wards claims between 10 and 50 of them.",
      "To provide a sense of how small divisions are, currently, the average number of registered voters per division is 616. The division out of the 59 with the lowest turnout counted 139 votes in 2012; the highest was 612.",
      "As Billy Penn reported, after Sean Hannity reiterated that 59 divisions with all-Obama votes showed signs of election rigging, a West Philadelphia elections inspector took to Twitter to debunk it. The key nugget in his explanation was this: Votes cannot be subtracted from Philadelphia voting machines. Republican City Commissioner Al Schmidt confirmed that was indeed the case. So, if anyone had voted Romney, there's no way that vote could've been removed from the tally, which means if fraud had occurred, it would've had to have happened before the vote button was pushed.",
      "Some of the 59 divisions had fewer than 10 registered Republicans, according to records from April 2012. The average number of registered Republicans in these divisions was 17. The Philadelphia Inquirer sought out many of these voters after the election, and found that the rolls could use some updating. Some, neighbors said, had moved, others straight-up told the Inquirer they didn't know the city had them down as GOPers. One man told the paper while he was a Republican, he had never actually voted that way.",
      "Experts say these divisions reflect a trend of heavily Democratic inner-city neighborhoods. Considering how few Republicans live in these micro-neighborhoods, it's not shocking that Romney would have a tough go of it against the nation's first black president, in 59 subzones that only represented a mere 3.5 percent of the city's vote in aggregate.",
      "Commissioner Al Schmidt told Billy Penn last week that in order for there to have been voter fraud, by adding votes in these divisions would have required \"hundreds of people engaging in a conspiracy, and no one finding out about it.\"",

      "Our ruling",

      "Looking at the voter records from six months prior, Democrats in these areas outnumbered Republicans more than 20 to one. That's before considering what the Inquirer's reporting suggests: That out of the small minority of GOPers in these sections, many don't align with the party, or don't appear to live there anymore.",

      "Correction appended",
      "Somehow, we're still talking about whether or not voter fraud is widespread in Pennsylvania. And once again, we'll repeat: Most studies and experts say it's not.",
      "During a debate televised on 6ABC on Oct. 16, Republican candidate for Pennsylvania attorney general and state Sen. John Rafferty was in the process of bolstering his calls for a statewide voter ID provision when he implied \"illegal\" voting in Pennsylvania is widespread.",
      "\"Recently though, the media has reported on thousands of illegal voters here in the commonwealth,\" he said during the debate. His opponent, Democratic candidate and Montgomery County Commissioner Josh Shapiro, shot back \"That's just simply not true\" to which Rafferty responded: \"Read the papers.\"",
      "Concerns about voter fraud and illegal voting in Pennsylvania have been a major concern this election, especially as GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump has circulated factually inaccurate claims about voter fraud in Philadelphia. So we decided to check Rafferty's claim.",
      "His campaign provided PolitiFact with three citations to back up his claim that the media has recently reported on \"thousands\" of instances of illegal voting in the commonwealth. The first wasa nearly two-year-old report in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, which reported that more than 700 Pennsylvanians may have cast two ballots or voted elsewhere in the 2012 general election. In that year, about six million votes were recorded in Pennsylvania, meaning those 700 votes would have accounted for less than 0.0001 percent of the vote. President Obama won the state by 300,000 votes.",
      "The story cited Carol Aichele, Pennsylvania's former Secretary of State and a proponent of the implementation of voter ID laws. (She oversaw its passage in Pennsylvania and testified in the trial that ultimately led to the state Supreme Court ruling the measure unconstitutional.) At the time, Aichele told the newspaper that more than 700 Pennsylvania voters had the \"potential\" to cast two ballots in the election.",
      "Experts say double voting is actually quite rare. A report by the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law noted that accusations of widespread double voting are often couched with a \"might\" and are probably more common than actual double voting.",
      "\"These cases are extremely rare not because such documentation is hard to come by (many states require that such documents be retained), but because actual double voting is itself extremely rare,\" author Justin Levitt wrote in the report. \"Moreover, the scarcity is expected, given the severity of the penalty (criminal prosecution), and the meager nature of the payoff (one incremental vote).\"",
      "The second media report cited by the Rafferty campaign was a January story by The Philadelphia Daily News about three former Philadelphia elections officials pleading guilty to violating the state election code. The story refers to two separate examples of voter fraud. The first was a case of a poll worker who cast a vote for her 23-year-old son in the 2015 primary. The second stemmed from the 2014 primary, in which the defendant voted for her mother.",
      "The final citation provided by the Rafferty campaign was a New York Times story detailing a fraud scheme in Philadelphia that encouraged hundreds of voters to cast absentee ballots even though they didn't have a legal reason to. The story was from February 1994.",
      "Those examples don't add up to \"recent\" media reports about thousands of voters casting illegal ballots in Pennsylvania. PolitiFact was able to find two additional media reports that did cite \"thousands\" of illegal voters in Pennsylvania.",
      "The first of those reports was an Oct. 11 report titled \"Potentially Thousands of Illegal Voters in Pennsylvania\" and was published by LifeZette, a website founded by conservative pundit Laura Ingraham. It cited an incident where mailers were sent to thousands of Pennsylvania voters including, potentially, some undocumented immigrants inviting residents to register to vote. It didn't actually register them.",
      "The second report was published this week notably after Rafferty made his claim during the 6ABC debate and was titled: \"Proof: Thousands of GOP votes likely stolen in Pa.\" It was published by WorldNetDaily, a conservative news and commentary website founded by Joseph Farah, a noted \"birther,\" or person who believes President Obama was not born in the United States. That story's \"proof\" was a widely-debunked theory about 2012 voting in Philadelphia.",
      "Elections officials in Pennsylvania say widespread illegal voting is often cited during contentious elections and conversations about implementing voter ID requirements but isn't particularly common. A 2012 report on voting irregularities in Philadelphia suggests most are a result of clerical errors.",
      "Our Ruling",
      "During a 6ABC debate, candidate for attorney general John Rafferty said \"Recently though, the media has reported on thousands of illegal voters here in the commonwealth.\"",
      "To back up that claim, the campaign provided three citations: One of which was 22 years old and not recent, one that was related to instances of voter fraud that netted an additional two votes and one that suggested about 700 voters had the \"potential\" to vote twice, but there wasn't evidence those individuals actually did. Those do not add up to the media \"recently\" reporting on \"thousands\" of instances of illegal voting.",

      "Pew researchers use data from a long-term survey that started tracking 5,000 families in 1968 and follows those parent-child pairs as they form their own households (known as Panel Study of Income Dynamics). Since economic mobility is best measured when people are in their prime working years around age 40, we won't have a third generation comparison for another decade or two, Elliott said.",
      "The United States has a greater degree of \"stickiness,\" in which people at both extremes of the income distribution are likely to stay in the quintile into which they were born, than neighbor Canada, she said, referencing this report.",
      "The Brookings Institution and Pew Charitable Trusts teamed up on a 2008 report that analyzed several studies on economic mobility and concluded the following:",
      "Cross-country comparisons of relative mobility aren't always based on perfect data. But the United States is distinct from other countries, research shows, in having \"less, not more, intergenerational mobility than do Canada and several European countries.\"",
      "Upward mobility is particularly uncommon for children who are born into families at the lowest income bracket.",
      "A previous examination of this issue by PolitiFact Ohio mentioned a 2010 study by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, a Paris-based think tank with 34 member countries, including the United States. The study found Denmark, Australia, Norway, Finland, Canada, Sweden, Germany, Spain and France out-ranked the U.S. in terms of a child's ability to earn more than his or her parents. Only Italy and Great Britain had stronger links between a person's earnings and his or her parents than the U.S. of the 12 countries evaluated.",
      "Why is this happening?",
      "A 2012 New York Times article that examined five studies about the United States' lagging economic mobility identified the depth of American poverty as one culprit, as the country has a \"thinner safety net\" than other wealthy nations.",
      "Other potential reasons the Times reported include the increased likelihood of poor Americans to be raised by single mothers, decreased unionization, high incarceration rates and the country's historical racial divide.",
      "A college education is one way for children born into the lowest income distribution to move up despite their family background, noted a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. But for many born into the poorest bracket, college is out of reach. Just 7 percent of adults whose parents were in the bottom income quintile obtained a college degree.",
      "Disagreement, caution and another measure",
      "Is it time to ring the alarm? Not yet, say some economists of conservative backgrounds. Among their concerns of the methodology and thrust of some of the research we have described:",
      "It is not wise to compare U.S. data with considerably smaller, more homogenous populations in European countries, such as Denmark.",
      "The evidence is scant that income inequality is hurting or driving our country's economic woes.",
      "Looking at absolute mobility, or comparing a person's income to their parents', reveals a different story than isolating the measure that most of these studies used (that's relative mobility, or looking at where an adult landed in the income distribution compared to his or her parents).",
      "For children born into the lowest quartile, 83 percent made higher family incomes than their parents, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, which examined the same long-term family survey that Pew uses. As a whole, 67 percent of U.S. adults out-earned their parents.",
      "Thing is, we don't have solid comparisons for absolute mobility for other countries, said Donald Schneider, a Heritage researcher who addressed his concerns about international comparisons of economic mobility in a whopping 6,700-word piece.",
      "We won't visit each point here (this is getting long enough -- eat a cookie, you deserve it). Basically, he cautioned the data used for some of these studies is not collected in the same way, and cultural differences could account for some of the income gaps.",
      "Plus, he wrote, Americans have to make more money to move from the bottom to the top than in countries such as Denmark.",
      "But many see that as the problem, said Julia Isaacs, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who studied international comparisons of generational income mobility in 2007. More distance means more inequality.",
      "\"We have more distance from the top to bottom,\" she said, \"and whether that's a good or bad thing may depend on your point of view.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Steven Rattner said, the United States is \"behind many countries in Europe in terms of the ability of every kid in America to get ahead.\"",
      "Some conservative economists say the comparisons between countries are imperfect, that we need better data, and Americans are doing just fine if you look at their ability to simply out-earn their parents. We don't know how that compares to European countries.",
      "But many studies back up Rattner's point. Studies show that we are behind \"many countries in Europe in terms of the ability of every kid in America to get ahead.\" Nordic countries have particularly higher rates of income mobility than the United States.",

That was 3 percent of News Corp.'s worth. In 2005, he increased his holding to 5.5 percent, the site states.",

    "body-text": [
      "The federal criminal charges filed against National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden make it seven times that the Obama administration has used the Espionage Act against government workers who shared information with the press. In at least two instances, the government's investigations have delved into the practices of reporters and news organizations and put reporters in legal jeopardy.",
      "This has raised red flags among defenders of the media. In a vigorous exchange on CNN's The Lead, host Jake Tapper asserted to Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post that \"the Obama administration has used the Espionage Act to go after whistleblowers who leaked to journalists ... more than all previous administrations combined.\"",
      "On one level, a simple tally would address Tapper's claim and -- spoiler alert -- the raw numbers back him up. But a scrupulous vetting of the record uncovers important ambiguities in the entire business of talking about leaks in Washington.",
      "The basic numbers",
      "Most tallies, like the one by the investigative service ProPublica, begin with Daniel Ellsberg and the release of the Vietnam War era documents known as the Pentagon Papers. Including Ellsberg, the government has used the Espionage Act 10 times to prosecute government workers who shared classified information with journalists. If we push back to 1945, there is one more case. So of those 11, seven have taken place while Barack Obama has been president.",
      "Law professor David Pozen at Columbia University, has researched the culture of unauthorized disclosures in the nation's capital and said generally, there has been an uptick in these prosecutions on Obama's watch..",
      "\"There's not really any doubt,\" Pozen said.\"The spirit of the assertion is correct.\"",
      "The whistleblower label debate",
      "The Justice Department does not quibble about number of prosecutions but in a statement to PunditFact, the department said: \"It is definitely not the case that anyone who leaks classified information is a whistleblower. Very few of those prosecuted in recent years for unauthorized disclosures even sought to be considered that way.\"",
      "To take a couple of examples, in 2010, State Department contractor Stephen Kim was indicted for providing information about North Korea to Fox News. Later that year, Jeffrey Sterling, a Central Intelligence Agency officer, was indicted for sharing information with a journalist James Risen about America's work to counter Iran's nuclear program. Both defendants have pled not guilty.",
      "There is little suggestion that whatever they might have revealed had to do with any government abuse or that the leakers wanted to raise broad policy concerns. The Legal Information Institute at Cornell School of Law defines a whistleblower as \"an employee who alleges wrongdoing by his or her employer of the sort that violates public law or tends to injure a considerable number of people.\"",
      "No matter how broadly interpreted, Kim and Stirling don't seem to fit that definition. In a statement given to ProPublica, the Justice Department said it does not target whistleblowers who follow the rules, but \"we cannot sanction or condone federal employees who knowingly and willfully disclose classified information to the media or others not entitled to receive such information.\"",
      "We raised this issue of who is and isn't a whistleblower with Tapper and he said in the fast pace of a live interview, he might have wanted to use slightly different words to make his point.",
      "\"It would be better to say leakers, many of whom are seen as whistleblowers,' instead of just whistleblowers',\" Tapper said. \"If for no other reason that the focus would be on the administration's aggressive use of the Espionage Act to clamp down on whistleblowing and journalism that holds the U.S. government accountable.\"",
      "As for the claim, though, it does not matter much. If you pull out the Kim and Stirling cases, by the same standard, you'd likely drop one of the pre-Obama cases too and that would still leave the Obama administration using the Espionage Act five times compared to three times before he took office.",
      "The mechanics of prosecutions",
      "Other factors could muddy the tally. The Obama administration inherited two of the cases from President George W. Bush's Department of Justice. The indictments took place under Obama but \"the wheels started turning before him,\" Pozen said. So potentially, someone could argue that these cases are not really his prosecutions. On the other hand, that doesn't affect the technical accuracy of Tapper's claim.",
      "In addition, administrations have a variety of ways to crack down on unauthorized disclosures. Tapper's focus on the Espionage Act might be accurate, but it overlooks other tactics used by previous White House regimes, said Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center at New York University School of Law.",
      "\"Instead of criminally prosecuting media leaks, the government has relied on administrative sanctions and penalties,\" Goitein said.",
      "These are extremely difficult to track because just about all of the details are protected by personal privacy laws.",
      "Goitein pointed to other laws that can and have been brought to bear, including Section 641 of Title 18 in the U.S. Code. It prohibits theft of government property. It was used in 2002 against a Drug Enforcement Agency official who gave sensitive, not classified, information to a London newspaper. While capital punishment isn't an option, in other respects, a conviction under Section 641 can be just as harsh as a violation under the Espionage Act. But neither a charge of theft nor an administrative sanction change the accuracy of the specific details in Tapper's claim.",
      "A look at the reasons behind the uptick under Obama lies outside the scope of this fact-check. For a complete discussion, we recommend Pozen's recent article, \"The leaky leviathan:Why the government condemns and condones unauthorized disclosures of information.\" Among other factors, digital technology both makes leakers easier to find and opens the door to disclosures on a grand scale as in the Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden cases.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Tapper said more than all previous administrations combined, the Obama administration has used the Espionage Act to go after whistleblowers who leak to journalists. The number of cases involving that law support Tapper's statement. There is reasonable debate over whether the whistleblower label applies to all cases and Tapper said he could have been more precise.",
      "However, the Justice Department does not challenge the basic figures and the experts we contacted affirmed the general accuracy of the claim.",
      "We rate the statement True."

      "On Fox News's The Five, hosts Bob Beckel and Eric Bolling came down on either side while discussing how the economy has fared under President Barack Obama.",
      "America has \"the most number of deductions available to corporations,\" Beckel said. \"They pay lower taxes than a lot of European countries do, and under Obama, I have not seen corporate taxes go up all that much.\"",
      "\"Just to fact-check you a little bit,\" responded Bolling, \"we have the highest corporate tax rate in the free world.\"",
      "Beckel repeated his point, then Bolling pointed towards Pfizer and Burger King going overseas for what he called \"tax inversion.\"",
      "\"They're going there specifically to capture a lower corporate income tax,\" said Bolling.",
      "We separately checked Beckel's claim about deductions, but in this check, we'll see whether Bolling is correct that the United States' corporate tax rate ranks as the highest in \"the free world.\"",
      "The rate in theory",
      "We decided to focus on the countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, a group that includes most advanced, industrialized nations. That fits our bill for a proxy for \"the free world.\"",
      "Out of the 34 countries in the OECD, America ranks first with a 39.1 percent corporate tax rate, compared to an OECD average of 24.1 percent. The OECD figure is what's called the statutory rate, meaning the base rate applied to corporate profits.",
      "According to the Tax Foundation, two non-OECD countries -- the United Arab Emirates (55 percent) and Chad (40 percent) -- have a greater statutory rate than the United States. But the UAE is governed by a monarchy and Chad is a developing country, so we don't think they would fit into the \"free world\" category Bolling used.",
      "The rate in practice",
      "PolitiFact, our sister site, has looked at several variations on Bolling's claim and ruled them Mostly True almost every time. The reason for the \"mostly\" qualifier is that companies aren't actually taxed at the statutory rate.",
      "Tax deductions -- on health insurance, pensions, and investment returns, for example -- allow corporations to reduce the pool of taxable profits. So economists often look at what they call the effective tax rate, which experts have told us is just as valid a measurement of corporate tax rates as the statutory rate.",
      "But whereas the statutory rate is relatively straightforward and uncontroversial, different, reputable organizations have published very different estimates of the effective tax rate that corporations pay.",
      "The most recent estimate comes from the World Bank and International Finance Commission, which put the United States' effective rate for 2014 at 27.9 percent. That's second-highest behind New Zealand among OECD countries and 15th-highest among the 189 countries measured.",
      "In 2011, the Tax Foundation published a survey of 13 prior estimates of the United States' effective tax rate from 2005 to 2011. All 13 studies pegged the U.S.'s rate as above average, but none had the U.S. rate first overall.",
      "Another 2011 study by the Congressional Research Service put the U.S. effective rate at 27.1 percent, slightly lower than the OECD average of 27.7 percent.",
      "Taxes are convoluted",
      "Different studies disagree on effective corporate tax rates because corporate tax rates tend to vary widely depending on the industry, said Alan Viola, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.",
      "\"The biggest deduction that varies across countries is how generous the depreciation schedule is,\" said Alan Viard, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \"When a business does an investment, equipment, a building, they don't normally get to deduct the whole cost that year. They have to do it over time.\"",
      "Faster is better, said Viard, but depreciation rates vary depending on what types of equipment a company is buying.",
      "Many studies also don't account for what the United States classifies as S-corporations, meaning businesses that pay tax through the individual income-tax system rather than the corporate income-tax system, Viard said. This represents about 30 percent of American companies, he said.",
      "So while effective tax rates are a good estimate of the corporate tax burden in the United States, particular businesses' burden may vary.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Bolling said the United States has \"the highest corporate tax rate in the free world.\" He was referring to the statutory rate, meaning the rate before deductions. On that score, he's right: The United States does have the highest statutory rate among developed countries. However, the United States' corporate tax rate doesn't appear to be the highest once deductions and other exclusions are taken into account. So Bolling is correct by one valid definition. Because his statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate his claim Mostly True."

      "Why the reporters lost their jobs is the heart of the case. According to Akre and Wilson, WTVT caved to pressure from Fox corporate and Monsanto, and fired the pair when Akre threatened to take what Akre described as the station's deliberate news distortion to the Federal Communications Commission. According to WTVT, the reporters submitted a biased and inaccurate report and were terminated after they refused to make the necessary edits.",
      "In 2000, a Tampa jury ruled that WTVT did indeed retaliate against Akre and awarded her $425,000, the Tampa Bay Times (then the St. Petersburg Times) reported. WTVT then appealed the case. In 2003, the Florida Second District Court of Appeals reversed the ruling, arguing that Akre's retaliation allegation did not hold water.",
      "Whistleblowing in the dark",
      "Akre's allegation and the meme involve the intersection of three pieces of media policy: the FCC's false news provision, the FCC's whistleblower's statute, and the First Amendment.",
      "According to Akre, WTVT deliberately distorted news by airing a revised version of the Posilac story. That, Akre says, is prohibited under the false news provision. When Akre threatened to notify the FCC, the station fired her and breached the whistleblower statute that prohibits retaliation against employees who disclose an employer's \"violation of law, rule, or regulation.\"",
      "The station denied repeatedly that it had tried to broadcast distorted news and said it wanted fair and balanced reports from Akre and Wilson. WTVT argued that the FCC's news distortion policy is more a rule of thumb than a codified law, and thus not under the purview of the whistleblower statute. The appeals court agreed.",
      "Stuart Benjamin, a professor of telecommunications at Duke University, said he doesn't see anything in the legal documents that suggests WTVT admitted to any lies or distortion. Rather, the station argued, and the court agreed, that Akre failed to meet her burden of proof, according to Benjamin.",
      "\"If a statute prohibits me from hitting you only if I act with malice, and you say that I hit you but don't establish malice, then I have a simple winning argument in court that you failed to show malice.That doesn't mean I agree I hit you. It just means I have a winning argument that focuses on the absence of malice,\" he said.",
      "Freedom of the press",
      "Beyond what was in writing, Akre doesn't remember WTVT admitting to lying and defending it as a legal right.",
      "\"I don't think they said it just like that, but they basically said we can do what we want,\" Akre told PunditFact. \"They kept saying we have First Amendment rights,' meaning they can operate with impunity and have the constitutional right to do so.\"",
      "The First Amendment, as well as the Florida Constitution, \"prohibits judicial review of Defendants' news judgments and the exercise of editorial discretion, consistent with the guarantees of a free press,\" the station argued in its defense statement.",
      "What this means is that the court shouldn't judge the editing choices of WTVT, the station's lawyer Patricia Anderson told The Weekly Planet.",
      "Anderson invoked the First Amendment because it is dangerous for the courts and the FCC to become involved in disputes between members of the media and tread on either party's freedom of press rights, according to Alison Steele, a media lawyer and Anderson's' former law partner. (Steele currently represents the Tampa Bay Times, which operates PunditFact.)",
      "Deni Elliott, a professor of media ethics at the University of South Florida, said that by invoking the First Amendment, Fox is suggesting that they are not accountable to anyone -- \"not a reasonable stand for a news organization to take.\"",
      "But to infer that WTVT used the First Amendment to defend news distortion and declare impunity is wrong. \"That wasn't ever their position,\" Steele said.",
      "\"There was never a factual or logical nexus established between the alleged crippling of the First Amendment and the firing of these two individuals,\" said Thomas McGowan, a media lawyer who was part of WTVT's defense team.",
      "Liane Casten, the reporter who wrote the the Chicago Media Watch article that originated the meme, said WTVT admitted to the false news allegations and defended it as a legal right during the trial, but could not recall the specifics. That position, however, is not corroborated by Akre.",
      "Steele, who worked with WTVT's attorney, said it's possible lawyers conceded the point as a hypothetical. But it was never central to their legal argument, nor an admission in the sense Casten or the meme suggests.",
      "\"I can certainly imagine that in oral argument. The other side says, If you did do this,' and you respond, If I did, it doesn't matter.' That's just part of the refining and defining what the legal argument,\" she said. \"This happens all the time, but it's not an admission.\"",
      "The ruling",
      "The Internet meme claims, \"Fox admits they lie\" and, under the First Amendment, \"have the right to lie or deliberately distort news reports on public airwaves.\"",
      "The claim doesn't track back to the national cable network most people know. Instead, it's rooted in a wrongful termination lawsuit between a Tampa Fox affiliate and two reporters. The heart of the suit was whether the Fox affiliate wrongly fired the reporters over a story about a synthetic growth hormone in Florida dairy cattle.",
      "The reporters and the station disagreed about the accuracy of the story.",
      "As part of the lawsuit, lawyers for the station argued that the courts do not have the right to play referee on story decisions -- citing the First Amendment.",
      "We found no evidence that the Fox affiliate admitted that it lied about the news it ultimately presented, and we certainly found no evidence that Fox News as a whole admits it lies (in the present tense).",
      "While the Fox affiliate argued that it has the right to present the news as it chooses, it's quite a leap to suggest Fox as a television corporation defended some right to \"distort news reports\" -- other than in a hypothetical sense to quash a wrongful termination suit.",
      "This meme wasn't conjured out of thin air, but it's not accurate. We rate it False."

      "We can't draw conclusions beyond that, however, because the arrest data simply doesn't allow us to draw firm conclusions about the number of arrests for violent crimes by white and black men. We should note that data show that the majority of black murder victims are murdered by blacks, and the same holds true for whites.",
      "There are other caveats. The arrest data blends Hispanic offenders into both the white and black groups, which further muddies the discussion of ethnicity and crime. Also, arrests are not the same as criminal acts themselves. Setting homicide aside, many violent crimes go unreported and many offenders are never caught. Also, a single criminal could be counted several times if he is arrested for different offenses. To further complicate the picture, police departments patrol certain neighborhoods more than others, which makes arrests in those places more likely.",
      "When we contacted Kohn, she agreed that her number was off. The percentage she used included both white men and women, and applied to all sorts of crimes, from loitering to murder. Kohn corrected that error in her opinion piece.",
      "Accounting for population size",
      "Setting aside using the wrong number, the larger problem with Kohn's claim is that her data point tells only half the story.",
      "There are two ways to talk about threats. Kohn chose one -- looking at what fraction of arrests for violent crimes are by a certain type of person, in this case, white men. The other way is to assess the likelihood that a certain type of person will be arrested for a violent crime. This second approach typically comes down to stating the number of crimes for every 100,000 people who are white, black, etc.",
      "Kohn used this method herself when she talked about incarceration rates for blacks compared to whites. It is true that blacks are imprisoned at about six times the rate as whites, but the source she used compared the incarceration rates for every 100,000 blacks and whites.",
      "When Kohn said that 69 percent of arrests for violent crimes were white males, she left out the population factor.",
      "\"You can't talk about risk without talking about population size,\" Fox told PunditFact. \"There are many more whites than blacks so it makes sense that the number of crimes will be high.\"",
      "Using the homicide count (again, the only crime where we can separate on both race and gender) whites and blacks were arrested in about equal numbers. But cast as a rate, the results shift. For 2013, Fox calculated that black men were about seven times more likely than white men to be arrested for murder. That would be a rate of 33 murders for every 100,000 black men, compared to 4.7 for every 100,000 whites.",
      "Drawing on the 2012 figures, whites were arrested for over 275,000 violent crimes. For blacks, the number is about 170,000. So while whites were arrested more, the arrest rate for blacks is nearly four times that for whites.",
      "Does that mean that from the point of view of the average citizen that blacks pose a greater threat?",
      "Not necessarily.",
      "\"If one considers the absolute number of offenders and it turns out there are a larger number of offenders from Group A than Group B, then it stands to reason that Group A is the greater threat in terms of likelihood of criminal acts,\" said Lorie Fridell, a criminologist at the University of South Florida.",
      "Robert Brame, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina, echoed Fridell's assessment.",
      "\"The statistical fact is that you're more likely to be a victim of a white perpetrator than a black one just because there are so many more whites in the population,\" Brame said.",
      "But, Brame, continued, it is not enough to speak of either the total number or the population-based rate.",
      "\"My preference would be for both statistics to be provided to give the full context,\" Brame said. \"Neither statistic is complete without the other.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Kohn said that white men are at least as dangerous as black men and cited as proof that white men represent 69 percent of people arrested for violent crimes.",
      "When presented with the inaccuracies in using that specific figure by PunditFact, Kohn corrected herself.",
      "Criminologists we contacted also told us that those absolute figures -- when used correctly -- tell only half the story. When talking about risks to society, it is equally important to provide the population-based rate. When we do that, the threat of violent crimes posed by blacks looks larger than that of whites.",

      "Much of the discussion about the Clinton family foundation has focused on who donated to it and what they may have expected in return from then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. But critics of the Clintons have opened up another line of attack on what is formally known as the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, charging that it doesn't actually spend very much on charitable works.",
      "Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh aired this line of argument on April 23, 2015, citing a report in the Federalist, a conservative publication. Here's a portion of what Limbaugh said:",
      "\"The Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation -- 99 percent pass-through. The Clinton Family Foundation pass-through is 15 percent. The Federalist reports only 15 percent of the money donated to the Clinton Family Foundation went to actual charitable causes. The bulk of the money donated to the Clinton Family Foundation went to travel, salaries, and benefits. Sixty percent of all the money raised went to other expenses. In other words, folks, 85 percent of every dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation ended up either with the Clintons or with their staff to pay for travel, salaries, and benefits. Fifteen cents of every dollar actually went to some charitable beneficiary.\"",
      "As this claim was circulating, the Clinton Foundation pushed back. The foundation tweeted, \"More than 88% of our expenditures go directly to our life-changing work.\"",
      "The difference between 15 percent and 88 percent is wide, so we decided to check Limbaugh's claim. A representative with Limbaugh's radio network didn't answer an email inquiry.",
      "An unusual approach for a foundation",
      "When most people in the charitable world think of foundations, they think of organizations that give away a lot of money in the form of grants to others who go out and do good works. The Clinton foundation works differently -- it keeps its money in house and hires staff to carry out its own humanitarian programs.",
      "This set-up means the Clinton foundation's finances get complicated in ways other foundations do not.",
      "Partly because of that, one of the leading independent groups that track charities -- Charity Navigator -- has been flummoxed about how to analyze that foundation and has stopped rating it, at least for now.",
      "Charity Navigator says it has \"determined that this charity's atypical business model cannot be accurately captured in our current rating methodology. Our removal of The Clinton Foundation from our site is neither a condemnation nor an endorsement of this charity. We reserve the right to reinstate a rating for The Clinton Foundation as soon as we identify a rating methodology that appropriately captures its business model.\"",
      "What is counted in the foundation's financials?",
      "The Federalist article that Limbaugh cited dug into the Clinton foundation's tax forms known as 990s, which nonprofits have to file annually with the Internal Revenue Service. Here's an excerpt from the Federalist article:",
      "\"When anyone contributes to the Clinton Foundation, it actually goes toward fat salaries, administrative bloat, and lavish travel. Between 2009 and 2012, the Clinton Foundation raised over $500 million dollars according to a review of IRS documents by The Federalist (2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008). A measly 15 percent of that, or $75 million, went towards programmatic grants. More than $25 million went to fund travel expenses. Nearly $110 million went toward employee salaries and benefits. And a whopping $290 million during that period nearly 60 percent of all money raised was classified merely as other expenses.' \"",
      "The Clinton foundation, on the other hand, gets to its 88 percent going to \"life-changing work\" by combining the finances of the Clinton Foundation and an affiliated organization, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, that before 2010 had been part of the Clinton Foundation proper. The Clinton Health Access Initiative works with governments and private groups to lower the costs of treatment for HIV/AIDS in the developing world.",
      "The Clinton Health Access Initiative was split off from the foundation because \"they got so big they needed their own organization to do it,\" said Craig Minassian, a spokesman for the foundation, in an interview with PolitiFact. But in putting together its annual report for 2013, the Clinton Foundation folded together both groups before calculating the numbers.",
      "Some question the logic for doing it this way.",
      "\"Clinton allies are deliberately conflating the activities and finances of multiple independent nonprofit organizations and hoping you'll view everything together as The Clinton Foundation,' \" Sean Davis, who wrote the Federalist story, told PunditFactc. \"That's just not the case, though.\"",
      "The correct number for the Clinton Foundation alone -- which owned the account the tweet was sent from -- was just over 80 percent in 2013, not 88 percent.",
      "The Clinton Foundation's unusual model",
      "As we noted earlier, many foundations carry out charitable works by giving money to other organizations that, in turn, do the ground-level charity work, whereas the Clinton foundation's charitable works are mostly done by people on the foundation's payroll. \"We are an implementing organization rather than a grantmaking organization,\" said the foundation's Minassian. That's why the Clinton Foundation's 990s show a relatively small amount of money categorized as \"grants\" -- only about 10 percent of all expenses in 2013.",
      "The foundation says its own employees are doing its charitable work. The annual report -- which, remember, includes both the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative -- says that 7 percent of expenditures were spent on \"management and expenses\" and 4.5 percent for \"fundraising.\" (The numbers on the 990s for the two entities are in the same ballpark.)",
      "Add those two percentages together and you get almost 12 percent; subtract that from 100 percent and you get the magic 88 percent figure the foundation cited.",
      "An independent academic CPA who specializes in nonprofit foundation finances said Limbaugh's error was in assuming that all spending beyond grants amounted to wasteful overhead.",
      "\"When Mr. Limbaugh says most of the spending is on salaries, travel, and other, that is not particularly informative,\" said Linda Parsons, an associate professor of accounting at the University of Alabama's Culverhouse College of Commerce. \"Travel and salaries for those who are directly carrying out the mission of the organization are much different than salaries and travel for executives who are networking in order to raise funds or for those who manage the organization. The response from the Clinton foundation that they carry out their missions directly, rather than outsource it to another organization or series of organizations, makes sense given that the Clinton Foundation reports travel, salaries, depreciation and conferences directly.\"",
      "Of course, Parsons' interpretation depends on trusting the Clinton foundation's characterization of its expenditures. As with any institution that files tax forms, the Clinton foundation has to characterize on its own what counts as \"management\" and what counts as spending on front-line charity work.",
      "The Federalist article says the foundation's tweet exaggerates when it says money spent \"directly\" on \"life-changing work,\" when in fact the group, by its own calculations, \"spent nearly $8.5 million 10 percent of all 2013 expenditures on travel. Do plane tickets and hotel accommodations directly change lives? Nearly $4.8 million 5.6 percent of all expenditures was spent on office supplies. Are ink cartridges and staplers life-changing' commodities?\"",
      "In response to a PolitiFact request, the Clinton Foundation said the expenditures for its programs are \"inclusive of salaries for staff, large-scale conferences (which is how the foundation convenes partners to take action such as the Clinton Global Initiative and the Health Matters conference), training for farmers and other beneficiaries, as well as direct program expenses like purchasing seeds and fertilizer for our agricultural programs and medical equipment for our public health work.\"",
      "Reasonable people can disagree about how to categorize expenses, said Janet S. Greenlee, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Dayton business school.",
      "\"There is no approved, required, or suggested method for allocating costs between program and nonprogram spending, so two charities that have the same financial events may have totally different financials,\" Greenlee said. \"Limbaugh is saying everything that's not direct service must be a waste of money, while the foundation is probably estimating that most of its other costs are actually direct service and so are accounted as such. The truth,' if there is such a thing, is somewhere in between.\"",
      "The foundation sent PolitiFact a rough geographic breakdown for program spending in 2012 and 2013. It cited expenditures split between 66.2 percent for the United States, 18.1 percent for South America, 5.6 percent for Southeast Asia, 4.9 percent for Sub-Saharan Africa, 3.6 percent for Central America and the Caribbean, 1.2 percent for West and Central Africa and 0.4 percent for Mexico.",
      "That's more than we had expected to see in domestic spending -- we're checking with the foundation on why that was so high, and will report their explanation if we receive one -- but even if the foundation devoted as little as one-third of its expenses to programs outside the U.S., then Limbaugh's 15 percent estimate would be too low.",
      "To offer some context, spending 88 percent of expenses on charitable programs, as the Clinton foundation says it does, would actually be pretty good by industry standards. Parsons said the average reported across all organizations in the National Center for Charitable Statistics is 81 percent -- equal to the Clinton Foundation's rate on its own -- and the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance suggests a minimum of 65 percent. \"The foundation exceeds that,\" Parsons said.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Limbaugh said \"85 percent of every dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation ended up either with the Clintons or with their staff to pay for travel, salaries, and benefits. Fifteen cents of every dollar actually went to some charitable beneficiary.\"",
      "There's a grain of truth here -- roughly 85 percent of the foundation's spending was for items other than charitable grants to other organizations, and a large chunk of this 85 percent did go to Clinton Foundation staff for travel, salaries and benefits. However, the foundation says it does most of its charitable work in-house, and it's not credible to think that the foundation spent zero dollars beyond grants on any charitable work, which is what it would take for Limbaugh to be correct.",
      "The claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False."

      "Not Bernie Sanders. He chose a colder route. Sanders and his wife, Jane Sanders, spent their first days as newlyweds in the Soviet Union, claims George Will in a recent Washington Post column.",
      "Will's Aug. 7 column focused mostly on the legacy of Robert Conquest, who died Aug. 3 at age 98, and whose writings on Soviet prisons documented the atrocities of the Stalin regime. A reader asked us to look into the accuracy of the final paragraph of Will's column, which invoked Sanders' \"honeymoon.\"",
      "It reads:",
      "\"Conquest lived to see a current U.S. presidential candidate, a senator, who had chosen, surely as an ideological gesture, to spend his honeymoon in the Soviet Union in 1988. Gulags still functioned, probably including some of the cold Auschwitzes' in Siberia, described in Conquest's Kolyma.' The honeymooner did not mind that in 1988 political prisoners were as may still be the case being tortured in psychiatric hospitals.' Thanks to the unblinking honesty of people like Conquest, the Soviet Union now is such a receding memory that Bernie Sanders's moral obtuseness the obverse of Conquest's character is considered an amusing eccentricity.\"",
      "We wanted to see if Sanders actually honeymooned on the turf of the United States' former adversary during the final years of the Cold War.",
      "Sister cities",
      "The trip took place while Sanders was mayor of Burlington, Vt., from 1981 to 1989. Toward the end of his mayoral tenure, the small city on Lake Champlain launched a sister-city program with Yaroslavl, located 160 miles northeast of Moscow.",
      "The program, which is still operating today, has facilitated exchanges between the two cities involving \"mayors, business people, firefighters, jazz musicians, youth orchestras, mural painters, high school students, medical students, nurses, librarians and the (Yaroslavl) ice-hockey team,\" according to its website.",
      "Along with sister-city relationships with Bethlehem in the West Bank and Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, the Yaroslavl program was part of Sanders' unorthodox attempt to take on international issues from a small city in New England. Sanders also actively pursued his agenda outside of the country, writing letters to world leaders and even traveling to Cuba to meet with the mayor of Havana.",
      "\"Burlington had a foreign policy,\" he wrote in his 1997 book Outsider in the House, \"because, as progressives, we understood that we all live in one world.\"",
      "The bond between Burlington and Yaroslavl solidified when Sanders and his wife, as members of a 12-person delegation from Burlington, paid their Soviet counterparts a visit in 1988.",
      "The timing of the trip was unusual. Bernie and Jane were married May 28, 1988. The delegation left Burlington the next day.",
      "\"Trust me,\" Sanders writes in the book. \"It was a very strange honeymoon.\"",
      "When reached for comment, Sanders' campaign said that the dates for the trip had already been set, and the couple \"set their wedding date to coincide with that trip because they didn't want to take more time off.\"",
      "In a 2007 interview, Jane Sanders also recalled the peculiar timing: \"The day after we got married, we marched in a Memorial Day parade, and then we took off in a plane to start the sister city project with Yaroslavl with 10 other people on my honeymoon.\"",
      "Bernie Sanders also refers to the trip sarcastically as \"quiet and romantic\" in his book.",
      "The \"honeymoon\" was dotted with meetings, interviews and diplomatic functions. A June 2015 profile in The Guardian described the former mayor's meeting with Yaroslavl city officials:",
      "\"After receiving a rundown of central planning, Soviet-style, from Yaroslavl's mayor, Alexander Riabkov, Sanders notes how the quality of both housing and health care in America appeared to be significantly better' than in the communist state. However,' he added, the cost of both services is much, much, higher in the United States.' \"",
      "An education in central planning probably wasn't the only item on Sanders' itinerary. Yaroslavl is home to historic churches and buildings, and the Sanderses would have been in for some good sightseeing, said Ariel Cohen, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.",
      "Will made it sound as if Sanders was visiting to condone Soviet torture practices, but the Burlington trip was more of a dialogue-building exchange program. The Vermont weekly newspaper Seven Days reported in 2009 that the sister-city relationship \"helped local residents who sought to ease tensions between the United States and Soviet Union by initiating citizen-to-citizen exchanges with a Russian city.\"",
      "Also, the Soviet Union was barely intact at the time of the trip.",
      "Negotiations had opened up between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev a few years earlier. \"It was at the beginning of perestroika,\" said Michael Briggs, a spokesman for the Sanders campaign, referring to the restructuring policy Gorbachev instituted in the mid 1980s.",
      "Gulags still existed and political prisoners were still held in 1988, said Ariel Cohen, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. But a watershed moment came when Gorbachev allowed physicist Andrei Sakharov to return from internal exile two years earlier.",
      "\"The power of the Communist Party was being questioned and the confrontation with the West was winding down through negotiations,\" Cohen said.",
      "In 1987, Reagan and Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and in 1988, Reagan himself spoke in Moscow's Red Square. One year later brought the fall of the Berlin Wall. Three years later, the Soviet Union collapsed.",
      "Participation in the Burlington-Yaroslavl program has waned over the years, though it was viewed as a \"glamorous endeavor\" by many in Burlington at the time, program leader Howard Seaver said in 2009.",
      "Will could not be reached for comment through his researcher.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Will wrote that Sanders chose \"to spend his honeymoon in the Soviet Union in 1988.\"",
      "Sanders and his wife did travel to Yaroslavl, a city in the Soviet Union, after their wedding in 1988. In the sense that the trip came after the couple were married, the trip was a honeymoon. The two have also referred to the trip that way, albeit sarcastically at times.",
      "But it was an unusual honeymoon, to say the least. The trip's primary purpose was diplomacy, not leisure, and included about 10 extra guests.",
      "Will's claim is accurate but is missing context about the trip's underlying purpose. We rate his claim Mostly True."

      "As several of Donald Trump's Republican opponents have pointed out, his fiery statements on any given subject strike a chord among a set of voters who feel the political system has failed them. Tom Tancredo, a former GOP politician turned pundit, credits Trump for \"forcing all 17 Republican candidates to talk about the social costs of illegal immigration.\"",
      "In an Aug. 8, 2015, article for the conservative website Breitbart, Tancredo said the \"mainstream media including, sadly, major segments of the presumably conservative media, like the Wall Street Journal are working overtime to keep the American public and the American voters in the dark on the scope of illegal alien crime.\"",
      "Tancredo provided these bullet points:",
      "\"Between 2008 and 2014, 40 percent of all murder convictions in Florida were criminal aliens. In New York it was 34 percent and Arizona 17.8 percent.\"",
      "\"During those years, criminal aliens accounted for 38 percent of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and New York, while illegal aliens constitute only 5.6 percent of the total population in those states.\"",
      "Tancredo said his source was a presentation from a conservative think tank, the Center for Security Policy.",
      "Several readers asked us to look into Tancredo's core statement that between 2008 and 2014, \"criminal aliens accounted for 38 percent of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and New York.\"",
      "There are serious glitches in his claim. He botches the takeaway of the presentation, which has plenty of issues on its own.",
      "A botched summary",
      "We tried a variety of ways to reach Tancredo and did not hear back.",
      "In his column, he embedded a video of the presentation by the Center for Security Policy and invited readers to watch the whole thing.",
      "We did. The first thing that jumped out was Tancredo mangled the dates.",
      "He said \"criminal aliens\" accounted for 38 percent of murder convictions in five states between 2008 and 2014.",
      "In fact, the presentation offered numbers for 2005 to 2008.",
      "That's not the only issue. The presentation's author, James Simpson, told us he had emailed Breitbart about Tancredo's use of his presentation. \"(Tancredo) quoted the whole thing incorrectly,\" Simpson told PunditFact.",
      "Our research found that even if Tancredo had quoted the presentation as it was given, there would still be plenty of concern about its accuracy.",
      "State data not prevalent",
      "Simpson's report includes findings from two separate sources: an article that describes 2008-14 data from the Texas Department of Public Safety, and his digest of a 2011 Government Accountability Office report, which uses 2005-08 numbers.",
      "We got into the weeds of each source, and the fact is neither provides an accurate look at the percentage of murders committed by criminal aliens in those five states.",
      "The real figure may be impossible to know; Texas appears to be the only one of the five states that actually keeps track of convictions of criminal aliens. The \"criminal aliens\" label applies to noncitizens who have either legal or illegal immigration status. (It is incorrect to consider all of them as illegal immigrants.)",
      "With various estimates floating around in Tancredo's article, it's useful to start with the solid numbers out of Texas.",
      "The Texas Department of Public Safety continuously updates its tally of criminal aliens booked into local jails, tracking the charges filed and whether the person was convicted.",
      "The agency's latest report covers June 1, 2011, to July 31, 2015. In that time, 344 noncitizens were convicted of homicide. In about the same period, Texas had 4,571 murders. (There's a difference between calendar and fiscal years, but as of this writing, the differences balance out.) So based on counts of actual cases, criminal aliens account for 7.5 percent of all homicides in Texas.",
      "That figure is striking because it is one-fifth as large as the number Simpson gave in his presentation. Simpson said, \"Illegal aliens have committed 35 percent of all murders in Texas since 2008.\"",
      "Simpson told us he had not seen the official Texas report. He had relied solely on an article for PJ Media.",
      "In our view, official hard data beats something in an article.",
      "Murky federal data",
      "The numbers from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a widely respected source, are also imprecise which is obvious from all of the report's cautionary notes.",
      "In 2011, the GAO aimed to learn the cost of keeping criminal aliens behind bars. The government analysts wrote that due to the large number of arrest files, they randomly selected 1,000 criminal aliens in five states Arizona, California, Florida, New York and Texas and took a close look at their arrest records.",
      "The researchers detailed a host of caveats: At the state level, it's possible that some people are counted twice if, for example, they are first kept at a county jail and are then transferred to a state prison. And the margin of error for the overall tally of homicides, as well as other crimes, was +/- 20 percent.",
      "The GAO was clear about the lack of precision in its results. A close look shows why anyone should use them with great caution.",
      "Because this was a study of costs, the only state prisoners examined fell under a federal reimbursement program called the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). Working with broad estimates, the GAO gave the percentage of convicted murders in each state's population under that program. We used those percentages to come up with the number of criminal alien murderers in each state (see our chart).",
      "Without wading too deep into the weeds, we found that our analysis of the publicly available data wasn't matching up with Simpson's. Simpson's total of murders is about 7,085, and our estimate was much lower at 5,300-5,400. Further, in Florida, he reported three times as many killers as our estimate, and his percentage of all homicides due to criminal immigrants in Texas was about double the official number (albeit for a different time period).",
      "We should note that Simpson's numbers are the basis for Tancredo's claim that criminal aliens accounted for 38 percent of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and New York.",
      "When we asked Simpson about his figures, he said after several months of writing to the GAO, he got the actual raw numbers.",
      "But Simpson's figures must be based on some statistical assumptions, not raw data, because his total is larger than the number of individual cases examined by the GAO. And Simpson told us \"the whole thing is difficult to understand frankly, and they couldn't explain it very well over the phone either. I may have to go back to them for clarification.\"",
      "Also, Simpson compared the number of immigrants convicted of murder to the total number of murders. Tancredo said the percentages referred to all murder convictions. Since many murders go unsolved, that statement is clearly incorrect. This error underscores another way that Tancredo misquoted Simpson's work.",
      "We do have the number of people arrested for homicide in Texas 2011-2014 (a shorter period than the one for the number of criminal aliens convicted of homicide). Convicted aliens represent 12 percent of all homicide arrests, but it's important to note that due to the mismatched time periods, that figure is too high.",
      "The bottom line is this: Even the man who generated the numbers, which Tancredo then misquoted, expresses uncertainty about their precision.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Tancredo said that between 2008 and 2014, over one-third of the murder convictions in Arizona, California, Florida, New York and Texas were committed by illegal immigrants. The man who presented the data Tancredo cites said Tancredo \"quoted the whole thing incorrectly.\"",
      "Tancredo used the wrong time period. He thought the baseline number was homicide convictions when it was actually all homicides. Most important of all, he took the presentation he relied on at face value and ignored the hard numbers available from the Texas Department of Public Safety.",
      "And while Tancredo might not have known it, the researcher whose work he used himself has questions about the underlying data he used. We have hard data from Texas that refutes the big and estimated numbers Tancredo used. Undocumented immigrants do commit murder, but perhaps only one-fifth as often as Tancredo said.",
      "We rate the claim False.",
      "Update: We added the Texas homicide arrest data after we first published."

As several readers pointed out after we published our earlier fact-check, the CRS report cited 525,000 Union and Confederate dead, but a subsequent study revised that estimate upward to 750,000. The study's author acknowledged a great deal of uncertainty about the proper figure, and some experts later questioned whether it's wise to include so many deaths from disease perhaps two-thirds of the 750,000 figure since disease in an era of relatively primitive medicine was so widespread that it's unclear what share of fatal disease during that period was really a result of the war.",

That's 120,130 more gun deaths than war deaths -- about 9 percent more, or nearly four typical years worth of gun deaths. And that's using the most generous scholarly estimate of Civil War deaths, the biggest component of American war deaths.",
      "We'll offer some added thoughts for context.",
      "These figures refer to all gunfire-related deaths, not just homicides. In fact, homicides represent a minority of gun deaths, with suicides comprising the biggest share. In 2013, according to CDC data, 63 percent of gun-related deaths were from suicides, 33 percent were from homicides, and roughly 1 percent each were from accidents, legal interventions and undetermined causes.",
      "There's a risk in using a statistic like this to decry mass homicides carried out with guns. Using total firearm-related deaths makes the case against guns more dramatic than just using homicides alone.",
      "However, in our view, Kristof framed this comparison with care. He mentioned suicides not once but three times in his column, and he referred broadly to the \"unrelenting toll of gun violence,\" not specifically to the toll of gun homicides. Indeed, at one point, Kristof specifically referenced the impact that stricter gun laws can have on gun suicides, writing that in 1996, after a mass shooting in Australia, lawmakers tightened gun laws. \"The firearm suicide rate dropped by half in Australia over the next seven years, and the firearm homicide rate was almost halved,\" according to data published in the Journal of Public Health Policy, Kristof wrote.",
      "Finally, we'll note that Kristof's wording differed ever so slightly from the claim by Shields that we checked previously. While Shields said that \"more Americans have died from gunfire,\" Kristof wrote that \"more Americans have died from guns.\" Some may argue that guns don't kill people, people do. However, that's a philosophical judgment and beyond our ability to fact-check. Here, we'll stick to the numbers, and we find they're on Kristof's side.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Kristof wrote, \"More Americans have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all the wars in American history.\"",
      "Even using a significantly higher estimate for Civil War deaths than we did the last time we fact-checked this claim, the comparison still holds up. The number of gun deaths since 1968 including, as Kristof was careful to note, both homicides and suicides was higher than war fatalities by roughly 120,000 deaths, or almost four years' worth of gun deaths in the United States.

      "But if you read the National Journal story, it doesn't directly tie whatever money Trump got from his father to an eventual $8 billion today. Here's the key paragraph from a Sept. 2, 2015, article headlined \"The 1 Easy Way Donald Trump Could Have Been Even Richer: Doing Nothing.\"",
      "\"Had the celebrity busi ness man and Re pub lic an pres id en tial can did ate in ves ted his even tu al share of his fath er's real-es tate com pany in to a mu tu al fund of S&P 500 stocks in 1974, it would be worth nearly $3 bil lion today, thanks to the mar ket's per form ance over the past four dec ades. If he'd in ves ted the $200 mil lion that For bes magazine de term ined he was worth in 1982 in to that in dex fund, it would have grown to more than $8 bil lion today.\"",
      "There's a bit of informed guesswork behind these numbers because outsiders can only know so much about Trump's finances. The National Journal writer, S.V. D te, figured Trump started with $40 million in 1974. That's the year he became president of his father's real estate company. By one estimate, the firm was worth about $200 million and divided among Donald Trump and his four siblings, each would have received $40 million.",
      "But it's not as though the company was liquidated that year. Trump's father lived until 1999, so whatever happened, it's more complicated than Trump receiving a cash inheritance in 1974 and deciding what he would do with it.",
      "We're left with a question of how much money Trump got from his father and, most important, at what point those assets morphed from being his father's to being his.",
      "In 1982, after running his father's firm for eight years, Forbes magazine estimated Trump's worth at $200 million. Since he was in charge of the company, then those dollars are more his than his father's. The Journal article tiptoed around this uncertainty with careful phrasing. The author talked about Trump investing \"his eventual share of his father's real estate company.\" An eventual share is not cash in hand.",
      "Similarly, the article did not say that the estimated $200 million in 1982 was from Trump's father. D te told us in his view, that truly was Trump's money because the real estate company was worth more than that. D te said he didn't really care what the status of the assets was.",
      "\"I just wanted to get to the point of saying that given the amount of money he started with, to be a billionaire it's not too hard,\" D te said. \"I worded it as carefully as I did because there are a lot of uncertainties.\"",
      "Importantly, if the $200 million did not come from Trump's father, then you can't say that the father's money could have been worth $8 billion today.",
      "But the Occupy Democrats' Facebook post took a paraphrase of the National Journal piece and then edited the paraphrase down to the text on the image. Occupy Democrats editor Omar Rivero didn't defend the graphic he shared. Rivero said his group occasionally shares graphics made by others.",
      "\"As you can see in the post description and in the watermark, this graphic was made by Santa Pegatina, a political graphics maker,\" Rivero said.",
      "The best summary of the National Journal article is that it presents a hypothetical investment scenario using numbers that have some basis in the value of the Trump holdings, but aren't necessarily what Trump got directly from his father.",
      "Running the numbers",
      "Even if the underlying assumptions are dodgy, the math at least is in the ballpark.",
      "We used $40 million as the starting point for 1974. Honghui Chen, associate professor of finance at the University of Central Florida, told us the account would have grown to $3.94 billion by November 2015 if the money had followed the S&P 500 index and all dividends had been reinvested.",
      "This is a rough calculation that ignores taxes owed on dividends, but it's on the same scale as what the National Journal reported.",
      "Chen said it's trickier to calculate the value of $200 million invested in 1982.",
      "\"Because the stock market in 1982 was quite volatile, the current value of $200 million investment in 1982 would depend on the time at which it was initially invested,\" Chen said.",
      "If it went in right at the end of 1981, it would be worth $6.7 billion. Invested in June 1982, the value today would be $8.3 billion. Invested at the end of 1982, it would be worth $9 billion. Again, in the neighborhood of what the Journal said.",
      "There is a huge debate over Trump's current net worth. Estimates from outsiders, such as Bloomberg and Forbes, range from about $3 billion to about $4 billion. Trump says he has closer to $9 billion.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Occupy Democrats shared an image that said if Trump had taken the money he got from his father and simply put it in a fund that tracked the S&P 500, he'd have $8 billion today. While it's true that Trump got a leg up from his father on the order of many tens of millions of dollars, this specific claim suffers from a key flaw.",
      "The only way to hit the $8 billion mark is to start with $200 million in 1982, and it's wrong to say that was Trump's father's money. While the father's business put Trump on the path to have $200 million in 1982, Trump himself had been running the company for eight years.",
      "We rate this claim False."

      "Economists Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan wanted to explore racial bias in the job market.",
      "They responded to help-wanted ads for a variety of positions in the fields of sales, administrative support, clerical services and customer services posted in The Boston Globe and Chicago Tribune with fake resumes. The researchers plugged in made-up names on the resumes that are associated with African-Americans (they used Lakisha Washington and Jamal Jones as examples) or whites (Emily Walsh and Greg Baker) based on naming data for babies born between 1974-79 in Massachusetts. The name on each resume was randomly assigned, so the same resume in some cases had a black name and in others had a white name.",
      "Then they counted the callbacks.",
      "The resumes with white-sounding names spurred 50 percent more callbacks than the ones with black-sounding names.",
      "After responding to 1,300 ads with more than 5,000 resumes, the researchers found that the job applicants with white names needed to send 10 resumes to get one callback, but the black candidate needed to send 15 for one.",
      "It didn't matter whether the employer was a federal contractor or was described as an \"equal opportunity employer,\" as those also discriminated like the others.",
      "\"We find little evidence that our results are driven by employers inferring something other than race, such as social class, from the names,\" their paper states. \"These results suggest that racial discrimination is still a prominent feature of the labor market.\"",
      "Ross erred slightly in his exact wording. While white-sounding names spurred 50 percent more callbacks than the ones with black-sounding names, black-sounding names were 33 percent less likely to get responded to. (Thanks percentage change calculators.)",
      "The researchers cautioned that their findings do not reveal anything about gaps in hiring rates or earnings between whites and blacks. Also, they only focused on one avenue for job postings, newspaper ads, even though social circles represent a major way people find employment (not to mention that online postings for jobs are much more popular now than 2002).",
      "Still, their findings echoed similar preferences among employers for applicants with names that were not distinctively black.",
      "After we published our fact-check, Mullainathan told us by email that Ross's characterization of the study is \"broadly right,\" though it's possible the numbers have changed.",
      "\"I know there have been more recent studies but often in other areas (not employment but housing, etc.), and they continue to find large gaps today,\" he said.",
      "David Figlio, a Northwestern University professor of education and social policy and of economics, said he had no reason to think the dynamics have substantially changed.",
      "\"There have been a number of recent studies on related topics that suggest that similar patterns are still at work in other areas,\" Figlio said. \"So while I can't confirm the exact number, I believe the fundamental relationship to still be true.\"",
      "We found another National Bureau of Economic Research paper looked at a slightly related angle: whether having a name that sounded African-American posed significant harm for one's economic well-being.",
      "The authors analyzed naming patterns of children born in California from the 1960s to 2000. The names DeShawn, Tyrone, Reginald, Shanice, Kiara, Deja and Precious were very popular black names but \"virtually unheard of\" for white children, they found. Conversely, names such as Connor, Cody, Jake, Molly, Emily, Abigail and Caitlin were way more popular for white children. The differences in name preferences took off with the rise of the Black Power movement in the late 1970s, the authors said.",
      "The key difference between the papers is that economists Roland Fryer and Steven D. Levitt found \"little evidence\" that names alone can have a direct effect on one's economic livelihood, concluding that having a black name is \"primarily a consequence rather than a cause of poverty and segregation.\"",
      "But the authors said this does not necessarily negate the findings of Bertrand and Mullainathan. They noted that having a black name on its own is not likely to have a big effect throughout the interviewing process, as an employer who meets an applicant and discriminates on race would immediately notice his or her race during the meeting.",
      "Also, the fact that Levitt and Fryer did not find a significant impact \"could simply mean that their data aren't comprehensive enough,\" said Alan Auerbach, a University of California Berkeley economist.",

      "Is Hillary Clinton a hypocrite when it comes to equal pay?",
      "That's the question raised by some conservative commentators after a Washington Free Beacon story said Clinton paid her female Senate staffers 72 cents for every dollar earned by a male counterpart.",
      "As Fox News host Sean Hannity put it: \"As senator, she actually paid female staffers a lot less than the men.\"",
      "Hannity's guests, Democratic contributor Tamara Holder and former Vice Media co-founder Gavin McInnes, debated the story. Holder said the Free Beacon story was based on manipulated data. McInnes said the bigger picture was that women earn less in America because \"they choose to\" attend kids' piano recitals and not work late.",
      "We'll set McInnes' statement aside and focus on the attack against Clinton, the 2016 Democratic frontrunner.",
      "The Free Beacon story",
      "The Washington Free Beacon article headlined \"Hillary Clinton's War on Women\" looked at data from Senate expenditure reports submitted to the secretary of the Senate from 2002-08. (The reports are not available online for Clinton's time in office, but we found the information published at Legistorm.)",
      "The website focused on full-time staffers who worked a complete fiscal year, which runs Oct. 1-Sept. 30. Clinton was sworn in as New York's junior senator in January 2001, so the Free Beacon analysis does not include her first nine months in office.",
      "The Free Beacon analysis also excludes Senate employees who took leaves of absence, which is common for employees who leave for short periods to work on campaigns, or left after even 11 months of work within the fiscal year.",
      "Regardless, the Free Beacon concluded the median salary for a woman on Clinton's payroll was about $15,700 less than the median salary for the men of the office, or about $40,800 compared to $56,500 for men.",
      "\"The salaries speak for themselves,\" the story says. \"The data shows that women in her office were paid 72 cents for every dollar paid to men.\"",
      "Clinton campaign responds",
      "A Buzzfeed News headline on the same topic presents a completely different take: \"Internal Data: Hillary Clinton Paid Women And Men Equally.\"",
      "What's going on here?",
      "The Clinton campaign provided salary data for full-time staffers that worked in the Senate office as well as what they earned if they worked for a congressional committee or political groups Friends of Hillary, Hill PAC, and Hillary Clinton for President. The information showed names, positions and salaries for Senate staffers, Senate committees and applicable political activity from 2002-08.",
      "The data show a median salary of $40,000 for both men and women receiving official Senate pay over those seven years (excluding Clinton's pay, since she does not pay herself). The median salary remains equal if you factor in non-Senate work, too.",
      "The campaign argues this is a better picture of a staffer's annual earnings, as some staffers took time away from official duties to join in Clinton's presidential campaign efforts in 2007 and 2008. Huma Abedin, for example, earned $20,000 in 2008 as a senior adviser on Clinton's Senate staff, but she also made $150,000 working on the campaign that year, too.",
      "\"The Free Beacon based their analysis on an incomplete, and therefore, inaccurate set of numbers,\" Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin said. \"The fact is, Hillary Clinton paid full-time men and women equally.\"",
      "If you isolate the data from year to year, the median earnings between men and women were not so even. In 2002, female Senate staffers (excluding Clinton) earned a median of $33,000, while men earned $42,500. The median pay gap closed in 2005 to $41,000 for women and $43,000 for men, and then women exceeded the men's pay in 2006 and 2007.",
      "For what it's worth, there were more women working for Clinton overall than men in every year.",
      "Not doing the same work",
      "The fact is neither set of data provides a truly definitive answer to the following question: Did Hillary Clinton pay men and women equally?",
      "Neither set of data compares wages for men and women who do the same work, which is the key issue in claims about the wage gap.",
      "PunditFact ran into a similar issue when Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett Packard executive running for the Republican presidential nomination, accused President Barack Obama of not paying men and women equally. She said Obama was \"not paying women equally by his own measures in his own White House.\" Fiorina's claim rated Mostly False because she was using a misleading measure.",
      "In reality, politicians and pundits of all stripes have abused data about the gender pay gap. Democrats often fall into trouble by suggesting women earn 77 cents on the dollar compared to men for doing the same work. In reality, women and men often choose to do different work, and those choices impact pay as much or more than gender.",
      "In this case, the Free Beacon and Hannity are overlooking data gaps and the individual circumstances of life working in the U.S. Senate.",
      "There are more significant differences between the methodologies of the Clinton campaign and the Free Beacon. Unlike the Free Beacon, the campaign includes staffers who worked full-time but not for the entire year. Our friends at FactCheck.org, which also looked at this topic, points out that an assistant chief of staff, Dan Schwerin, earned a $35,000 salary, but he was not included in the Free Beacon's analysis because he took a two-week unpaid leave of absence to work on a House campaign.",
      "Norman Ornstein, a scholar of congressional pay at the American Enterprise Institute, said it's common for Senate staffers to temporarily leave payrolls to volunteer or work for campaigns and political committees. So he favors the Clinton campaign's approach.",
      "Making apples-to-apples comparisons is difficult, he said, \"but it is clear that the Free Beacon approach did not take into account the reality that people move in and out of payrolls on a fairly regular basis.\"",
      "Another wrinkle for the Free Beacon analysis: Legistorm, the nonprofit that records salaries in Congress, cautions users from extrapolating exact salary information from the twice-yearly reports from offices that it shares, pointing out in its FAQ that true earnings fluctuate depending on bonuses and leaves of absence to work on the political side.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Hannity said Hillary Clinton paid \"paid female staffers a lot less than the men\" than when she was a senator.",
      "One set of data supports that claim, but it is far from perfect. There are several ways of looking at Senate earnings one created by the Clinton campaign, for instance, undercuts Hannity's claim. In reality, all the datasets have caveats.",
      "While it's fair to note that Democrats can overreach on gender pay claims by using imperfect data, it doesn't mean critics can use the same imperfect data to make counterclaims.",

      "There is a grain of truth to this claim, but we found multiple problems -- the amount is off, and \"stolen\" is an inaccurate word to describe Clinton's actions. Also, despite the graphic's use of the word \"force,\" it's important to note that law enforcement did not come into play in this episode.",
      "When Bill and Hillary left town",
      "Federal rules strictly limit gifts for nearly every member of the executive branch, but the exceptions include the president and vice president. They may accept gifts, due to the needs of protocol and etiquette. There are some limits, but for the most part, if you want to show your appreciation for the occupant of the White House, you can. This courtesy extends to the entire first family -- and, importantly for this fact-check, if they want to keep those gifts when they leave, they can.",
      "The president must report gifts over a certain value; during most of the Clinton years, the amount was $250, though today it is $350. When Bill Clinton completed his term, he submitted a final disclosure form that listed roughly $190,000 in gifts.",
      "Clinton's itemized list caught the eye of the Washington Post and provided plenty of fodder for the curious. People gave the president a notable quantity of golf clubs. Movie star Sylvester Stallone gave him a pair of boxing gloves. Filmmaker Steven Spielberg sent him china. And one Steve Mittman from New York gave him two sofas, an easy chair and ottoman worth $19,900.",
      "The problem was, Mittman and a few others included on the list said they never intended their gifts to go to the Clintons. They thought they were donating to the White House itself as part a major remodeling project in 1993.",
      "This is where the questions of provenance get muddy. Some gifts are intended for the government, and must stay in the government's hands, while some are intended for the person living in the White House. But it's not always as simple as \"this is mine\" and \"that is Uncle Sam's.\"",
      "Within about two weeks of the publication of the Post article, public criticism escalated, and the Clintons announced that they would pay the government nearly $86,000 for items that were actually government property. A few days after that, they also returned about $48,000 worth of furniture (including the sofas, chair and ottoman from Mittman).",
      "Add that up and the government got back $134,000 out of the $190,000 the Clinton's had declared as gifts. But as an indication of how hard it is to determine ownership, the National Park Service, which oversees the White House property, later returned a chair and an ottoman to the Clintons.",
      "The House investigates",
      "The House Committee on Government Reform looked into the fracas over the Clintons' gifts. While its report never accused the former first family of criminal wrongdoing, it noted shortcomings in how gifts were processed, saying there was no independent assessment of gifts and that some had likely been undervalued.",
      "For example, lawmakers were skeptical of the estimated value of $240 for a John Quincy Adams-signed original land grant from 1826. There was also a large Coach leather travel bag, which the White House estimated at $200 but which investigators found priced at $498 to $698, and a Tiffany necklace valued at $150 but that Tiffany's valued at $450 to $1,000.",
      "There were instances of a twisted paper trail in which the National Park Service thanked donors for certain items but never formally added them to the permanent White House collection, which meant the Clintons could take them for themselves or for the Clinton Library.",
      "The committee found that giving things to the White House and its occupants was governed by several laws and six federal offices and agencies. Its overall conclusion was that the system was too complicated and left the government vulnerable. \"Since the current system is subject to abuse and political interference, there is a need for centralized accountability in one agency staffed by career employees,\" it said.",
      "Among the aspects of the case that lawmakers found troubling was the apparent violation of the ban on soliciting gifts. It's fine under the law to accept someone's generosity, but you can't tell them what you want. This came up in regards to a portion of the goods the Clintons kept -- about $38,000 worth of goods given to Hillary Clinton in December 2000. That was after she won her Senate race in New York, but before she took office, at which point accepting such gifts would have violated Senate rules. Clinton had created a gift registry at Borsheim's Fine Jewelry and Gifts. This yielded 16 rimmed soup bowls worth $2,352 and a soup tureen worth $1,365, among other items.",
      "Even before the registry episode, the White House had retained an interior decorator who, according to the report, coordinated 43 of the 45 furniture gifts received over the Clintons' eight years.",
      "Kathleen Clark focuses on government ethics law at Washington University in St. Louis. For her, that interior decorator raised a flag. \"I don't know how you coordinate gifts without soliciting them,\" Clark said.",
      "Ultimately, the first family retained 227 of 14,770 gifts given over the eight years.",
      "The accusation of theft",
      "The viral image accuses the Clintons of theft. However, their public declaration of all the things they were taking makes it harder to call what they did \"stealing.\"",

At issue were gowns worth as much as $25,000 and diamond jewelry that had been loaned to Nancy Reagan. A year before, the White House Ethics Office found that the president could accept a $2.5 million home in Bel Air, Calif., purchased on his behalf by undisclosed friends. However, the Reagans ultimately repaid the donors.",

      "According to top ethics lawyers, it's at least debatable -- and at worst hyperbolic -- to say the Clintons \"stole\" the items. A congressional investigation found poor tracking of ownership and final disposition of gifts, which makes it hard to speak definitively of wrongdoing.

      "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and his presidential campaign serve as an almost constant reminder that Hillary Clinton has not always taken the lead on issues near and dear to the more liberal members of the Democratic Party. She only recently declared that she opposed the Keystone XL pipeline that would link oil from the tar sand fields of Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast. On same-sex marriage, Clinton's views evolved.",
      "As PolitiFact has described, in 1999, Clinton both supported the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage as between a man and woman, and legal recognition of civil unions. By 2007, she opposed DOMA, but fell short of backing same-sex marriage. Then in 2013, she came out in favor of same-sex marriage pure and simple.",
      "Chuck Todd, the host of NBC's Meet the Press, focused on same-sex marriage during an interview with Clinton on Sept. 27, 2015.",
      "\"Bernie Sanders has been where you are on these issues,\" Todd said. \"Bernie Sanders was there when it came to marriage 20 years ago. Do you think one of the reasons he's doing well right now is some progressives think, Well, you know what? He was there when it wasn't popular.'\"",
      "Clinton said Sanders could speak for himself and used the question to attack Republicans.",
      "Here, we wanted to look at whether Sanders supported same-sex marriage two decades ago.",
      "What we found was long-standing support for gay rights in general, a voting record consistent with same-sex marriage, but not much in the way of public statements on behalf of same-sex marriage itself.",
      "An early gay rights backer",
      "Todd said Sanders was \"there\" on same-sex marriage 20 years ago, but we found evidence pointing back even further.",
      "In the early 1970s, Sanders ran for governor of Vermont under the banner of the Liberty Union party, a coalition of leftist groups. The party platform called for making taxes tougher on corporations and lighter on families, an end to the Vietnam War and a number of measures to get government out of people's private lives.",
      "\"The Liberty Union believe that there are entirely too many laws that regulate human behavior,\" Sanders wrote in an open letter. \"Let us abolish all laws which attempt to impose a particular brand of morality or right' on people. Let's abolish all laws dealing with abortion, drugs, sexual behavior (adultery, homosexuality, etc.).\"",
      "There's an image of that letter, thanks to Alternet.",
      "",
      "While you could read Sanders' sweeping reference to all laws dealing with homosexuality as including same-sex marriage, it doesn't specifically say that.",
      "As mayor of Burlington, Vt., Sanders supported a gay pride parade in 1983, saying \"we must all be committed to the mutual respect of each other's lifestyle.\" Sanders also put through a 1984 housing anti-discrimination ordinance that protected people based on \"his or her sexual preference.\"",
      "In 1995 on the House floor, Sanders came to his feet to chastise a Republican congressman who attacked supporters of a tougher Clean Water Act as \"the same people that would put homos in the military.\"",
      "According to a Boston Globe article at the time, \"You used the words 'homos in the military,' \" Sanders shouted at Cunningham. \"You have insulted thousands of gay people who have put their lives on the line in countless wars defending this country.\"",
      "So Sanders has a long track record on the side of gay rights in general.",
      "When it comes to same-sex marriage and Todd's reference to \"20 years ago,\" Todd is pointing to Sanders' votes related to the Defense of Marriage Act.",
      "The Defense of Marriage Act of 1996",
      "In May 1996, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., introduced a bill most notable for its section on definitions. The bill, best known as DOMA, empowered states to disregard same-sex marriages that might be legal in other states.",
      "It also defined marriage as \"only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word spouse' refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.\"",
      "Sanders had a couple of key opportunities to vote as DOMA moved through the House. As the bill was headed for a final vote, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., offered an amendment that would allow each state to set its own definition of marriage. Sanders joined about 100 lawmakers in supporting Frank's amendment, far short of the total needed.",
      "On DOMA itself, Sanders was part of a smaller group of opponents, just 67. The bill passed and President Bill Clinton signed it in September.",
      "We wondered if Sanders made any public statements about DOMA in 1996. A search of the Congressional Record and the Nexis news database turned up nothing. His campaign staff couldn't provide any examples from that time. We contacted Susan Murray, a Burlington lawyer and a co-founder of the Vermont Freedom to Marry Task Force. Murray said members of her group met with Sanders in 1996.",
      "\"He opposed DOMA and explicitly told Freedom to Marry so,\" Murray told us. \"The meeting was not focused on whether Bernie affirmatively supported marriage equality.\"",
      "Same-sex marriage was not on the legislative table in the mid 1990s. When Todd said Bernie was on board before it was popular, the survey numbers back him up. In 1996, Gallup found that 68 percent of the public opposed marriage between couples of the same sex.",
      "Vermont passed a civil union law in 2000. Sanders supported it. The year before, Gallup found that 62 percent of the public opposed marriages between people of the same sex.",
      "In 2006, Sanders opposed a Republican-sponsored constitutional amendment that defined marriage as between a man and a woman. In an Associated Press interview, Sanders said the measure was designed to divide the public, and he praised Vermont's civil union law. Vermont \"led the way,\" but noted that it was \"a very divisive debate.\" The AP reported that when asked if Vermont should legalize same-sex marriage, Sanders said, \"Not right now, not after what we went through.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Todd said that Sanders was \"there\" 20 years ago on the issue of same-sex marriage. What we found specific to same-sex marriage is that Sanders opposed defining marriage exclusively as between a man and a woman. He expressed that opinion through his votes, and in conversations with activists in his state.",

      "Donald Trump's relationship with Russia has become an issue because of several factors: his campaign's ties in the region; the claim that the leaks of Democratic National Committee email originated from Russian hackers; Trump's conflicting claims about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin; and Trump's invitation to the Russians to hack Hillary's Clinton's emails.",
      "Former Democratic U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner discussed Trump's Russian ties on the July 27, 2016, edition of Real Time with Bill Maher. (Weiner is married to Huma Abedin, a Clinton top adviser. Weiner resigned from Congress in 2011 after a sexting scandal.)",
      "\"The reason he loves Putin, we know this now. The banks no longer loan him money because he's a terrible risk. So he goes to these (Russian) oligarchs and borrows money. He knows the end game is coming for him. He's thinking about who he wants to ingratiate himself (with). We have a presidential candidate who is literally kind of approaching Russia on his knees because he needs them to loan him money.\"",
      "Banks are no longer loaning Trump money, and Trump is trying to get it from Russian oligarchs?",
      "When we contacted Weiner, he characterized his comment as \"informed speculation among real estate builders and bankers. There is some transparency on lending for buildings. But since he hasn't really built anything since the Soho Grand, there isn't much to look at. The part about him being a terrible risk is borne out by his record of not paying debts.\"",
      "So we went looking for some evidence on the question of who is lending Trump money.",
      "Hard evidence is lacking because Trump runs a private business, so most of his records are not available to the public. In addition, he has repeatedly refused to release any recent tax returns, which could be another indication of his source of capital.",
      "We sought out what's available.",
      "No loans for Trump?",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported in March 2016 that the candidate's available financial statements show that the struggling German bank Deutsche Bank \"is the only bank with a big Wall Street presence that continues to lend to him.\" Other large institutions do little if any business with Trump, the newspaper reported, but smaller institutions do.",
      "The Journal said \"many big banks have shunned him,\" but the paper also reported that Trump has few loans with big banks. \"Bankers say that's partly because Mr. Trump has moved away from developing multimillion-dollar real-estate projects to managing them and licensing the Trump name, reducing his need to borrow.\"",
      "Daughter Ivanka told the Journal that the big banks are not wary of investing with Trump: \"The biggest banking institutions are constantly soliciting us. But we don't need a lot of financing because we have a great balance sheet and a tremendous amount of cash.\" In addition, she said, Trump has moved to private banks that have lower interest rates.",
      "Nonetheless, various media outlets have stated, without offering any documentation, that Trump can't get funds from most banks.",
      "From Slate: \"After his 2004 bankruptcy and his long streak of lawsuits, the big banks decided he wasn't worth the effort. They'd rather not touch the self-proclaimed 'king of debt.' \"",
      "From Talking Points Memo: \"Trump has been blackballed by all major US banks.\"",
      "For his part, Weiner pointed us to an Aug. 2 commentary posted on Time.com, which reported that \"the real truth is that, as major banks in America stopped lending him money following his many bankruptcies, the Trump organization was forced to seek financing from non-traditional institutions. Several had direct ties to Russian financial interests in ways that have raised eyebrows.\"",
      "Which leads us to the Russian part of Weiner's claim.",
      "Loans from oligarchs?",
      "Weiner also sent us a Politico article explaining how Trump has tried to get Russians as tenants and buyers for his various properties, including a 17-bedroom mansion in Palm Beach, which he bought in bankruptcy for $41 million in 2004. He eventually sold the property to a Russian oligarch for $95 million in 2008. But that was a property sale. Weiner was talking about getting loans from oligarchs, a very different thing.",
      "Other media outlets have reported that Trump has actively marketed condo projects to Russians, particularly Russians with money to burn or hide. Politico reported that when it came to the Palm Beach property Trump sold to oligarch billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, Rybolovlev has probably never been in the house. He subsequently denied owning it and preparations are underway to tear it down.",
      "This may explain why, at a real estate conference in 2008, Donald Trump Jr., the candidate's son, said that \"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\"",
      "But the issue for this fact-check is borrowing money, and we couldn't find any evidence that Trump has been getting loans from any oligarchs. The few cases we found involved Trump partnering with people with ties to the region.",
      "Trump has been looking for business opportunities in the Soviet Union since at least 1987, when he flew there to try to develop luxury hotels in Moscow and Leningrad. None of the real estate deals ever led to a groundbreaking.",
      "Russian involvement in financing deals seems to be coming indirectly.",
      "The best-known example is a company that Trump partnered with for hotel-condominium projects one in Toronto, the other in Lower Manhattan known as Trump SoHo.",
      "The company that partnered with Trump is the Bayrock Group, chaired by former Soviet official Tevfik Arif, who hails from Kazakhstan. Bayrock has drawn attention for a host of reasons.",
      "First, one of its prominent associates is Felix Satter (later changed to Sater), a Russian immigrant with an office in Trump Tower in New York. Satter served time beginning in 1993 for slashing a man's face in a barroom brawl and, in a lawsuit, was accused of threatening to electrocute the testicles of a Trump investor, according to Slate. In addition, Satter was \"implicated in a huge stock manipulation scheme involving Mafia figures and Russian criminals,\" according to the New York Times. He later became an FBI informant.",
      "Second, when the company's finance director, Jody Kriss, sued Bayrock for fraud, Kriss alleged that the company, founded in 1989 in Moscow, was \"backed by oligarchs and money they stole from the Russian people.\"",
      "According to that lawsuit, \"Month after month for two years, ... whenever Bayrock ran out of cash, Bayrock Holdings would magically show up with a wire from somewhere' just large enough to keep the company going.\"",
      "Also feeding into the pot of Bayrock money was a fund called the FL Group. Kriss' lawsuit says it attracted Russian investors \"in favor with Putin.\" It chipped in $50 million in 2007, which became controversial after the $50 million partnership deal was re-classified as a loan, a move of questionable legality because it seemed to be designed to avoid U.S. taxes, according to the British newspaper the Daily Telegraph.",
      "This may seem far removed from Trump, but the Telegraph reported that Trump signed off on that deal. According to the paper, Alan Garten, Trump's lawyer, claimed that the billionaire had simply signed letters acknowledging the deal as a \"limited partner\" with Bayrock.",
      "The Kriss suit, while claiming that \"tax evasion and money-laundering are the core of Bayrock's business model,\" also says, \"There is no evidence (Donald) Trump took any part in, or knew of, their racketeering. Any contrary inference would be unjust.\"",
      "(Editor's note, Aug. 16, 2016: After we published our fact-check, we received a response from a representative for Bayrock, which said, \"The allegations made by Jody Kriss are baseless and unsubstantiated.\")",
      "The Trump campaign declined to comment when we inquired about Weiner's statement.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Weiner said of Trump, \"We know this now. The banks no longer loan him money because he's a terrible risk. So he goes to these oligarchs and borrows money.\"",
      "Weiner called it \"informed speculation.\" But at PolitiFact, we operate on the principle that the person making the claim is responsible for providing evidence. In this case the evidence is lacking, in part because Trump has revealed so little. Even his net worth remains a mystery.",
      "Nonetheless, records show that banks are still loaning money to him, albeit not the big U.S. institutions. There's no evidence to prove that it's because the large banks have shut him out.",
      "Similarly, there's little evidence to show that Trump has been seeking loans from oligarchs instead of financial institutions. There's circumstantial evidence that oligarchs have been involved in his business dealings, but mostly through intermediary companies that own a financial stake in his projects. That's different from a direct loan.",
      "Because the statement seems to contain some elements of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.",

We love you, we love you all the way to the White House!\" Myriam Witcher said enthusiastically into a microphone, flailing her arms up in the air while gripping an American flag and a People magazine with Trump on the cover.",
      "Witcher, an immigrant from Colombia, garnered attention for her lavish praises during the October 2015 rally in Las Vegas, particularly because Trump had presented a hard-line immigration stance, including talk of mass deportation.",
      "Soon after her on-stage appearance, rumors spread that Witcher had been deported. A PolitiFact Texas reader recently emailed us saying reports of her deportation were being shared widely, including on Facebook.",
      "We wondered, where's Witcher?",
      "Still on U.S. soil, Witcher told PolitiFact.",
      "Rumors of her deportation started last year despite being a naturalized U.S. citizen, Witcher said via a phone interview. Though she lives in Las Vegas, Witcher on Nov. 30 said she was in New York.",
      "According to the rumors, \"up to this day, I'm still deported,\" Witcher said. \"I don't waste my time with that.\"",
      "Satirical post and other sites",
      "On Oct. 9, 2015, the day after Witcher appeared next to Trump, a Spanish-language satirical website based in Colombia posted an article headlined, \"They deport Colombian who declared her love to Trump.\"",
      "Actualidad Panamericana's 257-word satirical post said Witcher's return to Colombia was expected after a quick deportation order from immigration authorities. The piece said Witcher's immigration papers showed \"serious inconsistencies\" and that her real name was \"Miriam Encanto\" -- a spelling variation of her first name and a word for her last name that in English means \"charm.\"",
      "The post says that Witcher was picked up by immigration authorities while having dinner with Trump, and that enforcement officials showed up after receiving a call from a \"patriot with a toupee.\"",
      "An Actualidad Panamericana editor said they believe rumors of Witcher's deportation surged from their post. On its website, Actualidad Panamericana says its goal is to entertain and that all its content is fiction and does not correspond with reality.",
      "Talks of Witcher's deportation are also posted on another Spanish-language website, Coyotitos.com, a site that lacks information detailing who's behind it and the mission.",
      "The article on Witcher and other posts don't have publication dates or bylines indicating who wrote them. Their Facebook page says they are a media/news company, but they did not return a message requesting more information.",
      "Coyotitos' post about Witcher is headlined, \"Hispanic woman who supported Donald Trump has been deported by the Department of Migration.\" (There is no such department.) The article says different media outlets have started to report what happened to Witcher, \"who has been deported for not having legal immigration status.'\" The post warns the information has not been officially confirmed despite being widespread and that it should be taken with caution.",
      "Media interviews",
      "Anthony Avellaneda, a journalist for El Tiempo, a Hispanic publication of the Las Vegas Review-Journal, said he has occasionally interviewed Witcher. He quoted her in an article posted Sept. 9, 2016.",

      "Witcher also was featured in a video published Nov. 1 by a German publication, Spiegel Online. Witcher appears standing outside the Trump International hotel in Las Vegas and reaffirms her admiration for Trump. Witcher says she's a citizen and sports a Trump campaign pin on her blazer as well as a \"Vote Early Today\" sticker.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has an online search page to locate detainees who are in custody or who have been released within the last 60 days. There's no result for Myriam Witcher. (We checked the database for other variations of her name, too.)",
      "An Oct. 9, 2015, article by the Las Vegas Sun about Witcher's encounter with Trump reported that Witcher said she \"had to wait five years to earn legal status in the U.S.\"",

      "\"After immigrating to the United States and becoming a U.S. citizen, she has developed a deep appreciation for our country, and believes with all her heart that Mr. Trump will put America first and make our country great again. She is married to a native U.S. citizen from Texas, who is a veteran of the U.S. Navy submarine service,\" reads Witcher's book author description.",
      "Witcher campaigned for Trump, posting dozens of videos on her YouTube channel recapping his immigration plan and encouraging viewers to vote for him.",

      "Just days after winning another term as House Democratic leader, U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California was the target of a viral image that deliberately and falsely made it appear she said losing work shifts was a good thing for Americans.",
      "Conservative group Turning Point USA attacked Pelosi in a Dec. 8, 2016, Facebook post that showed her face next to a quote that read, \"Employers cutting hours is a good thing. It then gives that person time to pursue their dreams and passions.\"",
      "No context is given for when or why Pelosi may have said that, and we can't find any evidence she ever did. But the post was shared widely on social media nonetheless, including a popular thread on Reddit.",
      "It appears that the image is a misquote from a Sept. 22, 2013, State of the Union interview Pelosi gave to Candy Crowley on CNN. Not only did Pelosi not use the words being attributed to her, but the entire context of the conversation is lost.",
      "Crowley was asking Pelosi whether she had any reservations about the federal insurance exchange that was about to open for customers for the first time. HealthCare.gov was slated to debut Oct. 1, 2013.",
      "Some people worried that employers would limit shifts for many hourly workers in order to meet the Affordable Care Act requirement that employees who worked more than 30 hours had to have insurance coverage. (For the record, there's a bit of evidence that some companies did cut hours after the advent of Obamacare, but it's difficult to pinpoint why.)",
      "Here's the transcript of that portion of the interview, with video posted here:",
      "CROWLEY: \"Let me ask you then about Obamacare, itself. Coming up for a big date on Obamacare, October 1, when people can begin to sign up through the marketplaces. Do you have any reservations at all? Are you worried at all? And I ask you this because you know union leaders, I mean, James Hoffa is one of those who wrote a letter to you and said Obamacare as it now stands would, quote, destroy the foundation of the 40-hour work week.' That's pretty tough from a loyal Democratic constituency.\"",
      "PELOSI: \"Well, we're working on the issue that relates to all of these multiemployer plans, which unions are one and some are charities.\"",
      "CROWLEY: \"Bargaining rights or otherwise risks. There's more than one employer involved in a contract.\"",
      "PELOSI: \"More than one employer involved in a contract. And that has to be certainly clarified. There's just so much the president can do within the law. But there is some leeway to facilitate as we are in the Congress under the exchanges. So, I'm optimistic, because, we will find a path. But overwhelmingly for the American people, this is a liberation. This is life, healthy life, liberty, the freedom to pursue your happiness, which could be, follow your passion for good rather than follow your palate and be constrained by your policy. It's about wellness. It's about prevention, it's about a healthier America.\"",
      "So there was a discussion about employers potentially cutting hours, but at no time did Pelosi call that a good thing. What she did say was that the launch of HealthCare.gov was a good thing for Americans, because they would no longer have to stay in a certain job just to keep their insurance coverage.",
      "It's a talking point Pelosi had used before, and was attacked over before. It also was misrepresented the same way in 2013.",
      "Pelosi spokeswoman Caroline Behringer confirmed that the House minority leader did not say the words attributed to her.",
      "\"It is something we saw spread on the internet, but has no basis in reality,\" Behringer said.",
      "Our ruling",
      "A viral image quoted Pelosi as saying, \"Employers cutting hours is a good thing. It then gives that person time to pursue their dreams and passions.\"",
      "This attack first came up in 2013, right before the federal insurance exchange opened. It looks to be a misquote based on a CNN interview, in which Pelosi was asked about employers potentially cutting workers' hours to avoid having to buy them health insurance.",
      "Pelosi responded that Obamacare still \"liberated\" Americans, because workers had an option for affordable insurance beyond having to stay with an employer for the coverage. Those people would then be free to find a job they liked better and still be covered, she said.",
      "The image not only puts words in her mouth, it deliberately twists the meaning of what she really said. We rate it False.",

      "A widely shared post from a little-known website suggests that Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election could lead the courts to install Hillary Clinton as president.",
      "\"Breaking: Putin Interference Could Give Courts Legal Right to Make Hillary President,\" says a Dec. 11, 2016, post on USA Snich, a website so obscure that Googling \"USA Snich\" only brings up references to the Harry Potter game of quidditch (though it uses a \"snitch\") or articles about prison snitching.",
      "Yet the post got enough interest by social media users that it popped up in the list of questionable articles Facebook is sharing with PolitiFact and other fact-checkers. (The USA Snich post is actually a nearly verbatim reprint of one from the site SupremePatriot.com.)",
      "One reason for the wide sharing may be that the post hit a social media sweet spot: What it advertises would simultaneously outrage conservatives and give liberals hope. As it happens, the USA Snich post frames it in a way favorable to conservatives, calling the notion advanced in the headline \"scary\" and concluding, \"What a bunch of BS. This will never happen! #NEVERHILLARY.\" However, posts with a similar message as this headline also appeared on liberal sites, such as Occupy Democrats.",
      "So what's going on with the USA Snich post? Let's take a closer look.",
      "A legal precedent?",
      "The post links to an article published on the Huffington Post. It was written by a contributor -- not a Huffington Post staff member -- named Alex Mohajer, who is identified as \"political director of Bros4Hillary, a volunteer advocacy organization\" and the holder of a law degree.",
      "In the column, Mohajer writes that recent allegations of Russian-linked hacking could provide a basis for the federal courts to get involved with the election's outcome, through a case that's little known even among constitutional scholars.",
      "\"At least one federal court decision suggests there may be some federal case law on the question of whether it is possible to invalidate the outcome of an election after the fact when there is fraud, and replace a candidate benefitted by fraud with his opponent,\" he wrote. \"The case, Marks v. Stinson, is the first and only known case in which a federal judge reversed an election outcome.\"",
      "The 1995 case revolved around allegations that Democrat William G. Stinson colluded with election officials to cast illegally obtained absentee ballots. In February 1994, after Stinson had taken office, the federal judge ordered him removed and replaced by his opponent, Republican Bruce Marks. An appellate court affirmed the district court's intervention in the matter, but it objected to the court seating Marks, although because Marks was already serving, the court allowed him to continue for the remainder of the term.",
      "Here's the money paragraph:",
      "The case offers an \"interesting rationale that could theoretically be applied in part if, after Donald Trump assumes office, it is shown that Russian hacking (or any fraud, for that matter) robbed Hillary Clinton of the presidency,\" Mohajer writes. \"The case offers clues that imply courts may intervene.\"",
      "This is a novel legal theory. We asked Kermit Roosevelt, a constitutional scholar at the University of Pennsylvania, what he thought of it.",
      "\"I'm pretty confident that there's zero chance of it happening,\" Roosevelt said. \"I could see a court reversing the result of an election if fraud was proved along the lines of, Candidate A really won 150 to 100, but Candidate B fraudulently altered the records to make it look like he won 150 to 100.' But that's not what happened. No one credible is alleging that the election was affected by that kind of fraud. The votes recorded were the votes that were cast. They may have been influenced by fake news and Russian propaganda, but there's no judicial remedy for that.\"",
      "The USA Snich post",
      "In other words, the theory offered in the headline is, at most, the longest of longshots. So right off the bat, the headline elevates the urgency of a legal theory of uncertain value that had been advanced by one Clinton supporter.",
      "The USA Snich post (and the SupremePatriot post) also leave out a lot of cautionary words that Mohajer himself had inserted in his original column.",
      "While USA Snich did link to the Huffington Post column and reposted several paragraphs of what Mohajer wrote, none of the paragraphs reprinted actually addresses the legal theory underpinning the headline's claim that the courts could overturn the election. To find that, a reader would have to click the Huffington Post link, something many readers presumably won't make the effort to do.",
      "Mohajer's column acknowledges some significant questions about the theory. \"Obviously both the stakes and the office in question are much higher than in Marks v. Stinson,\" he wrote. \"There has been no case of first impression with regards to the presidency being overturned to a wrongful winner's opponent. There is also, of course, no constitutional Electoral College process or system in Pennsylvania, so the situations are not exactly analogous. It is not clear how the case would impact a presidential election.\"",
      "When we reached out to Mohajer, he said that being a law school graduate, he thought of the piece as \"an academic exercise.\"",
      "\"I thought it was an interesting case on election fraud and the only federal court ruling I could find that had a judge replacing an elected official with their opponent from the election because of fraud,\" Mohajer told PolitiFact. \"It would require courts use a liberal interpretation of the word fraud' and would probably require some wrongdoing by Trump.\"",
      "In the interview, Mohajer acknowledged that the likelihood of this scenario occurring is \"next to lightning striking the same person twice.\"",
      "\"Ultimately, is it plausible? Of course not,\" he said. \"But If you had asked me 12 months ago whether I thought Donald Trump would elected president, I would have answered in kind with the exact same certainty.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "USA Snich posted an item headlined, \"Putin Interference Could Give Courts Legal Right to Make Hillary President.\"",
      "This urgent headline is based on a novel legal theory that a constitutional scholar casts doubt upon, and that its own creator acknowledges is extremely unlikely to win the support of the jusicial system. Meanwhile, the text of the USA Snich article doesn't even address the substance of the legal argument outlined in the headline, and in so doing, it leaves out any sense that the author offered his own series of caveats about the legal theory's applicability. We rate the USA Snich headline False.",

      "The report says, \"The prevalence of drug use is only slightly higher among blacks than whites for some illicit drugs and slightly lower for others; the difference is not substantial. There is also little evidence, when all drug types are considered, that blacks sell drugs more often than whites.\"",
      "We checked the overall data from the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Here's the breakdown for all illicit drugs.",
      "",
      "There are racial differences in the types of drugs being abused, according to surveys by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Blacks, for example, are far less likely to have used marijuana, cocaine and hallucinogens in their lifetime than whites, but at least in the case of marijuana whites are more likely to give it up over time.",
      "With that backdrop, the National Research Council report says, \"In recent years, drug-related arrest rates for blacks have been three to four times higher than those for whites. In the late 1980s, the rates were six times higher for blacks than for whites.\"",
      "Here's the drug arrest rate trend:",
      "",
      "But Jones was talking about the rates of imprisonment for drug crimes, not arrest rates. Those numbers turned out to be harder to find.",
      "We turned to Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a research analyst for The Sentencing Project, an advocacy group in Washington. She pointed us to data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics reporting on the number of people going to state prison for drug offenses and numbers from the United States Sentencing Commission on the racial makeup of drug offenders going to federal prison.",
      "Those numbers aren't perfect for our comparison. For example, the state prison data only lists inmates based on their most serious offense, so someone convicted of a drug crime may not be listed in that category if that person was given a longer sentence for assault.",
      "Adjusting for the number of blacks and whites (another approximation because many Americans are of mixed race), the black imprisonment rate for drug offenses is about 5.8 times higher than it is for whites.",
      "That's very close to what Jones said.",
      "It should be noted that these numbers vary from source to source.",
      "The NAACP's Criminal Justice Fact Sheet asserts that \"five times as many whites are using drugs as African Americans, yet African Americans are sent to prison for drug offenses at 10 times the rate of whites.\" It doesn't list a source. Spokeswoman Raquel Coombs said the ratios may be out of date.",
      "We noted in the BJS data that the racial disparity has decreased significantly since 1991. That NAACP 10 percent imprisonment statistic appears to be based on 2003 data analyzed in 2009 by Human Rights Watch. (We also note that the drug-use statistic is easy to misread. Whites aren't five times more likely to use drugs. Five times more whites are using drugs because there are about 5.5 times more whites in the U.S. population than blacks.)",
      "We wondered why so many more blacks are going to prison for drug offenses.",
      "They're more likely to get caught selling drugs, as Michael Tonry, professor of law at the University of Minnesota, told us back in February. \"Whites are more likely to sell to people they know, and they much more often sell behind closed doors. Blacks sell to people they don't know and in public, which makes them vastly easier to arrest.\"",
      "Blacks arrested for drugs are more likely to be sent to jail because they're more likely to have had a previous run-in with the law. Police tend to patrol high-crime areas more aggressively, which tend to be the poor areas, which have a higher proportion of minorities. Thus, they're more likely to be stopped for something and have a rap sheet once a drug charge comes along.",
      "As we found in our previous fact-check, their sentences also tend to be longer.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Jones said that African-Americans don't use drugs at a higher level than whites but wind up going to prison six times more.",
      "African-Americans use drugs at roughly the same levels as white Americans, although overall illicit drug use among blacks has been marginally higher than for whites, with some differences in the types of drugs used, according to a national surveys.",
      "Jones' bigger point was about the disparity in sentencing, and the rate of African-Americans' incarceration for drug offenses is very close to what Jones said.",

      "Editor's note, May 4, 2016: We originally published this item on April 17 and rated it Mostly True. Since then, readers have contacted us to consider other evidence about the Democratic Party's fundraising processes, especially state parties sending money back to the Democratic National Committee. We have updated and rerated this fact-check based on new information, changing the rating from Mostly True to Half True. You can read an archived version of the original report here.",
      "You had to pay or collect as much as $353,000 per couple to attend recent fundraisers for Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, including one hosted at the home of actor George Clooney. After the affair drew protesters who support Bernie Sanders, Chuck Todd, host of NBC's Meet the Press, asked Clooney what happened when he encountered them.",
      "Clooney said he was accused of being a corporate shill, which is \"one of the funnier things you could say about me.\" Then he told Todd, \"The overwhelming amount of money that we're raising, and it is a lot, but the overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising is not going to Hillary to run for president, it's going to the down-ticket.",
      "\"It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress. And the reason that's important (is) ... we need to take the Senate back because we need to confirm the Supreme Court justice, because that fifth vote on the Supreme Court can overturn Citizens United and get this obscene, ridiculous amount of money out so I never have to do a fundraiser again. And that's why I'm doing it.\"",
      "Here, we're fact-checking Clooney's claim, \"The overwhelming amount of money that we're raising, and it is a lot, but the overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising is not going to Hillary to run for president It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress.\"",
      "What we found is that Clooney is technically accurate about most of the money not going to Clinton's campaign, but it's not necessarily going to \"congressmen and senators.\"",
      "Clooney is right about the direct support for Clinton's presidential campaign. Federal law says individuals can't give more than $2,700 to a presidential candidate's primary campaign. Another $2,700 can be collected for the general election. It doesn't matter whether you give it directly or a friend collects it from you on the candidate's behalf, the limit is there.",
      "Where the rest of those big-dollar donations end up is a bit of a maze. We'll try to walk you through it.",
      "In this case, the Clinton California fundraisers were held on behalf of the Hillary Victory Fund, which distributes the money to Clinton's campaign committee, Hillary for America. But it also distributes money to the Democratic National Committee and the state parties.",
      "A donor can also give up to $33,400 a year to the DNC and $10,000 a year to each of the state parties for use in getting its candidates elected to federal office. If you do the math, with 32 state parties included in the Victory Fund, that's $356,100.",
      "The state parties generally are tasked with helping elect Democrats at the state level, and the DNC does the same at the national level.",
      "The way the donations are divided is explained at the bottom of the Hillary Victory Fund page on the Clinton website. The first $2,700 goes to Clinton, the next $33,400 goes to the DNC and the rest goes to state parties.",
      "How does this translate into total donations for each group?",
      "If you look at the money going out, which is available through campaign finance reports, it looks like Clinton is getting most of the money.",
      "According to the Center for Responsive Politics by the end of 2015, the Hillary Victory Fund had given $4.4 million to Clinton, $2.3 million to the DNC, and $2.2 to state political parties. That makes Clinton's share through 2015 almost exactly 50 percent.",
      "In the first quarter of this year, Clinton's share was 63 percent of the money that was officially spent on campaigns. Politico reported that the fund also spent $6.7 million for \"online ads that mostly looked like Clinton campaign ads, as well as $5.5 million on direct marketing.\"",
      "The Clinton campaign gets the lion's share of the money collected by the Victory Fund, said Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin, because most of the donors give much smaller amounts, and everything up to $2,700 per person is earmarked to go to Hillary for America first.",
      "It's when a donor exceeds that limit that the excess spills over to benefit the national and state Democratic committees.",
      "Or in the case of the state parties that's how it appears on paper.",
      "Federal Election Commission records show that in most cases, the money given to the state parties has been immediately redirected to the DNC. The money isn't staying with the states at all.",
      "On May 2, Politico published a story reporting that 88 percent of the state money was immediately passed along to the DNC. In some cases, the state parties didn't even know the money had gone in and out of their accounts until after the fact.",
      "The Hillary Victory Fund sent $214,100 to Minnesota, for example, and that state party didn't keep a dime. It was routed to the DNC, which otherwise wouldn't have been able to accept the money \"since it came from donors who had mostly had already maxed out to the national party committee,\" Politico reported.",
      "We contacted the DNC and the Clinton campaign to try to understand what was compelling the states to immediately send funds back to the DNC. We couldn't get straight answers.",
      "The Clinton campaign provided a copy of the agreement with the state parties, but it contains no language requiring such a transfer. Although DNC spokesman Luis Miranda said that the terms of the agreement called for states to send the money to the DNC for election infrastructure, Clinton spokesman Schwerin was emphatic that the state committees were free to keep whatever money they wanted.",
      "However, a Feb. 20 Washington Post story on Clinton's fundraising efforts says the executive director of Utah's Democratic party said state party officials understood they were supposed to send back money to DNC headquarters.",
      "So if money is going back to the DNC, what's it being spent on?",
      "The overarching response of both the Clinton campaign and the DNC was that the money being diverted to the DNC was, in fact, being used to help local Democrats get elected. Those candidates need voter information, research, media monitoring, organizing capacity and other infrastructure services provided by the DNC to run a successful campaign, and that's how the money was being used.",
      "However, such services also benefit the Clinton campaign.",
      "\"The process Hillary Victory is using has been common practice for a number of years,\" said Bob Biersack, senior fellow at the Center for Responsive Politics. \"The states always agree because they have no choice. Transferring the money back to the national party is a condition of participating. They do it in hopes of getting some good will from the national party down the road.\"",
      "As for the degree to which the system really helps House and Senate candidates, Biersack said there isn't a precise answer.",
      "He noted that the party's congressional committees aren't party to the deal. \"If the goal was to support those campaigns, surely the national organizations most responsible would be participants. Traditionally the DNC and RNC are taken over by their presidential nominees during the election year, and the first priority for every spending decision is how it relates to the presidential race,\" he said. \"If that campaign were to become significantly less competitive, then the national party might well move to other races, but it would happen in that sequence and in those conditions.\"",
      "One final important note: Spokesmen for both the Clinton campaign and the DNC said many millions raised for the state parties have not been distributed yet, but will be soon.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Clooney said, \"The overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising, is not going to Hillary to run for president. ... It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress.\"",
      "Clooney is correct that most of the big-dollar donations in question are not going to Clinton's campaign for president. By law, they can't.",
      "Whether the money is \"going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress\" is a much different story.",
      "Most of the money appears to be winding up at the DNC, not state parties, as individual donors may have expected. The national party says that money is being used on campaign infrastructure that will benefit House and Senate candidates.",
      "But it will benefit Clinton, too.",

Cloture \"is the only formal procedure,\" for breaking a filibuster, according to Senate rules.",

      "Were there 3 million illegal votes from undocumented immigrants in this year's presidential election? Well, that's what some websites are saying.",
      "\"Report: 3 million votes in presidential election cast by illegal aliens,\" reads a headline on InfoWars, a conspiracy website ran by Alex Jones. The article has been shared via Facebook more than 48,000 times when we last looked.",
      "Other websites also have touted this report, including Milo, TheNewAmerican and FreedomDaily.",
      "So is there any truth to it?",
      "Well, we don't know for absolute certain. But the report is actually a tweet, and the person who authored the tweet won't explain how he arrived at his figure. If that isn't reason enough to be skeptical, independent experts and historical analyses suggest it's highly suspect.",
      "In other words, don't buy it.",
      "Where's the report?",
      "As evidence of its claim, InfoWars' headline refers to a report from VoteFraud.org and tweets from Gregg Phillips, whose Twitter profile says he's the founder of VoteStand, a voter fraud reporting app.",
      "There is no report from VoteFraud.org, however, and Phillips told PolitiFact he is not affiliated with that website. The information comes from tweets made by from Phillips on Nov. 11 and Nov. 13.",
      "Here they are:",
      "We have verified more than three million votes cast by non-citizens. We are joining .@TrueTheVote to initiate legal action. #unrigged",
      "Completed analysis of database of 180 million voter registrations. Number of non-citizen votes exceeds 3 million.Consulting legal team.",
      "Phillips would not provide any additional information when asked by PolitiFact. He said he has chosen not to release more information because he is still working on analyzing the data and verifying its accuracy. Phillips would also not say what the data is or where it came from, or what methodology he used.",
      "Phillips said he would release the information publicly once he is finally finished.",
      "According to his page on LinkedIn, Phillips is a former finance director of the Alabama Republican Party. He also served as executive director of the Mississippi Republican Party and was managing director of a super PAC that supported Newt Gingrich's 2012 campaign for president.",
      "Plenty of reason to be skeptical",
      "While we have no idea how Phillips arrived at his claim that 3-million noncitizens voted, people who have made similar claims in the past have cited a 2014 report that claims 6.4 percent of non-citizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 percent of non-citizens voted in 2010 midterm congressional elections.",
      "That report was based on data from a Harvard survey of people. But the data was flawed, which created flaws in the subsequent report.",
      "The authors of the survey say a small percentage of respondents, who are citizens, accidentally misidentified themselves as noncitizens on the survey. This is because the respondents didn't read the question carefully and accidentally selected the wrong response to the question.",
      "How do researchers know this? One of the authors of the survey, Brian Schaffner, said people changed their answers later when they were asked about their citizenship.",
      "\"When we took out people who changed their answer on the citizenship question and only look at people who answered consistently that they were noncitizens, we found no reported noncitizens who voted,\" Schaffner told PolitiFact.",
      "Other research contradicts Phillips' tweet.",
      "News 21, a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found just 56 cases of noncitizens voting between 2000 and 2011.",
      "A report by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law found that most cases of noncitizens voting were accidental. \"Although there are a few recorded examples in which noncitizens have apparently registered or voted, investigators have concluded that they were likely not aware that doing so was improper,\" reads the 2007 report.",
      "States that have tried to purge noncitizens from voter rolls, meanwhile, have found even government data lacking.",
      "In 2012, Florida Governor Rick Scott's administration started an effort trying to crack down on noncitizens voting by comparing driver's license data against voter rolls.",
      "Through this process the Florida Department of State created a list of 182,000 potential noncitizens that had voted. That number was whittled down to 2,700, then to about 200 before the purge was stopped amid criticism that the data was flawed given the number of false positives including a Brooklyn-born World War II vet.",
      "Ultimately, only 85 people were removed from the voting rolls. State officials began to pursue a second attempt at a purge in advance of the 2014 election but then abandoned that effort, too.",
      "Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine, called Phillips' claim \"fake news.\"",
      "\"There is no credible evidence I have seen to show large numbers of noncitizens voting in U.S. elections anywhere,\" Hasen said. \"The idea that 3 million noncitizens could have illegally voted in our elections without being detected is obscenely ludicrous.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Reports claim 3 million \"illegal aliens\" cast votes in this year's election.",
      "The articles point back to tweets from Gregg Phillips, who has worked for the Republican Party and has a voter fraud reporting app. But Phillips will not provide any evidence to support his claim, which happens to be undermined by publicly available information.",
      "If Phillips does release a more detailed report, we will consider that information. But for now, this claim is inaccurate. We rate it False."

      "Write-in votes for Harambe would be treated like provisional or absentee ballots, meaning they wouldn't be counted until after all the other votes, which takes weeks. We're still counting votes in California, for instance.",

      "Maria Teresa Kumar, CEO and president of Voto Latino, said on NBC's Meet the Press that \"no one is surprised\" by the New York Times report on Trump's personal finances and pointed out Trump's \"hypocrisy.\"",
      "\"He keeps talking about undocumented immigrants. Undocumented immigrants pay $12 billion of taxes every single year. They pay their taxes. They have skin in the game. He is not contributing to a system that he says he's going to go in and fix,\" Kumar said. (Editor's note, March 30, 2017: Subsequent news reports have indicated that Trump paid at least some taxes, specifically $38 million in 2005.)",
      "Kumar referred us to an Atlantic piece about undocumented immigrants paying Social Security taxes. It cites a note issued by the Social Security Administration in 2013 that contains the $12 billion figure. But the calculation is based on contributions from immigrants and their employers, not just the immigrants themselves.",
      "According to the Social Security Administration, there were nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States in January 2009. Factoring out kids, nonworking immigrants and those working in the underground economy and not paying taxes, the Social Security Administration estimated about 3.1 million unauthorized immigrants who worked and paid Social Security taxes in 2010.",
      "This group and their employers generated about $13 billion in payroll taxes in 2010. The administration then subtracted about $1 billion in benefits that could've been received in 2010 from earnings in years when workers were unauthorized. Workers and employers contribute roughly the same amount.",
      "In a 2014 Vice News piece, the Social Security Administration's chief actuary Stephen C. Goss affirmed the $12 billion contribution.",
      "Social Security Administration analysts said \"a relatively small portion\" of those who could draw benefits do so.",
      "Laws enacted in 1996 and 2004 block Social Security benefits paid to unauthorized immigrants or to any noncitizen without a work-authorized Social Security number at some point in time, the administration said.",
      "An analysis by the conservative Heritage Foundation came up with a lower figure: $7 billion, excluding payments from employers.",
      "Though Kumar told us she meant Social Security taxes in an email interview with PolitiFact, she didn't specify this on Meet the Press. Without the specification, her figure would have been more accurate about taxes overall.",
      "A 2016 study by the Institute on Taxation & Economic Policy, a left-leaning research organization, estimated that undocumented immigrants pay $11.64 billion in state and local taxes in 2013, equivalent to about 8 percent of their total income.",
      "This includes sales and excise taxes on goods and services ($6.9 billion), property taxes ($3.6 billion) and personal income taxes ($1.1 billion, assuming a 50 percent compliance rate).",
      "The Heritage Foundation came up with a similar result in a 2013 report. It found that the average undocumented immigrant household paid $10,334 in taxes. About half of these 3.4 million households do not pay any taxes.",
      "Using Heritage's analysis, that would translate to about $17.6 billion paid in taxes.",
      "Heritage noted that the average undocumented immigrant household received about $24,721 in government benefits and services (i.e. public education, welfare benefits and services like police and highways), resulting in a deficit of $14,387.",

      "The story claims that the doctors found the enzyme nagalase in vaccines, connecting nagalase to cancer, autism and diabetes. The article speculates that the doctors were murdered in order to prevent their findings from going public.",
      "We reached out to the website but got no response. (Neonnettle later emailed us to say it deleted the post.)",
      "Their argument is that nagalase suppresses the immune system and would therefore be bad if found in vaccines. There have been controversial studies that claim to show that the GcMAF protein, which aims at reduction of nagalase concentration in the body, could be treatment to diseases like cancer, autism, or HIV. These are all diseases where the nagalase level is supposed to be high.",
      "That theory lacks scientific evidence, though. The British government has warned against the purchase of GcMAF, since it is not licensed and its production does not adhere to production standards. Scientific journals where those theories were published have retracted them, because they are not proven.",
      "Healthnutnews.com identified five doctors it said were connected to the nagalase discovery. But we found little evidence that the deaths of doctors are were connected to the vaccine controversy.",
      "Dr. Bruce Hedendal, a 67-year-old doctor in Florida, was found dead in his car in June 2015. The actual cause of his death is not clear, but natural causes have been cited by Florida local TV stations. Hedendal was a chiropractor, and there are no reports that he was involved in challenging the pharma industry in any way.",
      "Another doctor from Florida, Dr. Theresa Ann Sievers, 46, was found murdered in her Florida home in 2015. An investigation found that her husband Mark had hired two men, Curtis Wayne Wright Jr. and Jimmy Rodgers, to kill her so he could collect insurance money.",
      "Again, her death was not connected to the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "In a follow-up article, healthnutnews.com broadened the theory to include two additional doctors. Dr. Jeffrey Whiteside, 63, went missing after a fight with his wife and was found dead. His death was ruled a suicide.",
      "Dr. Patrick Fitzpatrick,a 74-year-old retired eyedoctor, went missing while hiking in Montana. The police searched but never found him. A officer of the Gallatin County Sheriff's office told the Bismarck Tribune that Fitzpatrick may have suffered from occasional confusion, due to his advanced age. He also said that they had no reason to believe criminal activity was involved in this case.",
      "The only person who was actually involved in the vaccination debate was Dr. Jeff Bradstreet, 61. He became controversial for his claim that vaccines could cause autism, a theory that has been refuted by several studies. Bradstreet treated his autism patients with the GcMAF protein, which the FDA does not recognize as treatment for autism.",
      "According to the Rutherford County, N.C.. Sheriff's Office, his wounds appear to be self-inflicted. He was not murdered. But his death in 2015 gave way to a wave of conspiracy theories.",
      "While the article says these doctors died in connection with promoting theories about vaccines, only Bradstreet's case even comes close. And even that is a stretch.",
      "As for sourcing, neonnettle.com refers to thebigriddle.com, which posted the exact story a year ago. Thebigriddle.com cites conspiracyclub.co as its source, a site that doesn't exist anymore.",

      "Appearing after McCain derailed GOP efforts on July 28 to pass a bill in the Senate repealing the Affordable Care Act, the article blames the then-U.S. Navy pilot for the blaze.",
      "\"McCain train wreck career met an all time low when he was singlehandedly responsible for starting a fire on USS Forrestal Aircraft Carrier,\" the post read. \"The accident claimed the lives of 134 sailors and left permanently disabled another 161 who were dismissed from active duty.\"",

The Forrestal had recently been resupplied with munitions, including 1,000-pound bombs from the Korean War, stored on the deck, because modern bombs were in short supply. McCain's jet was parked on the deck, tail pointed outward before takeoff, as the ship sailed in the Gulf of Tonkin.",

      "But the official U.S. Navy report of the accident said the rocket hit White's plane, rupturing the fuel tank and igniting the jet fuel.",
      "A fragment also punctured the fuel tank of another Skyhawk next to White, spilling more fuel and igniting it. The rocket itself fell into the ocean without detonating, but a bomb from one of the aircraft exploded as crew members rushed to put out the flames. (Subsequent reports have noted modern bombs would not have \"cooked off\" the way the Korean War-era munitions did, contributing to the disaster.)",
      "Gregory Freeman, author of the 2002 book Sailors to the End, has sided with McCain's account, but conceded on his website that it was entirely possible the rocket hit both Skyhawks.",
      "Narrated video of the event showing the explosion is available on YouTube:",
      "McCain managed to escape his cockpit through the flames, suffering burns and shrapnel wounds in his legs and chest. He described the conflagration in his book:",
      "\"All around me was mayhem. Planes were burning. More bombs cooked off. Body parts, pieces of the ship, and scraps of planes were dropping onto the deck. Pilots strapped in their seats ejected into the firestorm. Men trapped by flames jumped overboard. More Zuni missiles streaked across the deck. Explosions tore craters in the flight deck, and burning fuel fell through the opening into the hangar bay, spreading the fire below.\"",
      "McCain wrote that he helped dump some bombs over the side of the ship before heading to the ready room and then sick bay to treat his wounds. He acknowledged the crew managed to control the flight deck fire by that afternoon, but below-deck fires lasted for another 24 hours.",
      "\"The fires were consuming the Forrestal. I thought she might sink,\" he wrote. \"But the crew's heroics kept her afloat. Men sacrificed their lives for one another and for their ship. Many of them were only 18 or 19 years old.\"",
      "The Forrestal was drydocked and refit, staying in service until being decommissioned in 1993. The fire, considered the worst combat-related naval disaster since World War II, led to changes in crew training and flight deck procedures.",
      "McCain transferred to the USS Oriskany, the aircraft carrier from which he took off on Oct. 27, 1967, the day he was shot down over North Vietnam and taken prisoner.",
      "Bloggers said McCain \"was singlehandedly responsible for starting a fire on (the) USS Forrestal aircraft carrier.\"",
      "Though specific details vary, no official or thoroughly researched account of the Forrestal fire blames McCain or any other particular pilot. A rocket from a jet other than McCain's misfired due to an electrical surge, hitting a plane from across the flight deck and starting the blaze. Several other factors contributed to the conflagration burning out of control and killing 134 sailors and pilots.",

      "A viral meme spreading through Twitter blames former President Bill Clinton for not just allowing North Korea to develop nuclear weapons, but fostering their program more than two decades ago.",
      "\"Bill Clinton gave North Korea $5 billion and two nuclear reactors in 1994, essentially giving them nukes,\" read the meme we first noticed on Aug. 9, 2017.",
      "It included an image that showed Clinton seated next to late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. It's worth noting that the photograph is actually from Aug. 4, 2009, when Clinton traveled to Pyongyang to negotiate the release of two American journalists. Kim Jong Il died two years later.",
      "HELP KEEP POLITIFACT GOING! MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO SUPPORT INDEPENDENT FACT-CHECKING",
      "The meme popped up after revelations that Kim Jong Un's regime had potentially developed miniaturized nuclear devices capable of fitting inside intercontinental ballistic missiles.",
      "The center of this claim that Clinton negotiated a deal with North Korea that included two reactors is based on a real agreement. But there are significant problems with the assertion that Clinton paid the country $5 billion, \"essentially giving them nukes.\"",
      "While president, Clinton did broker a deal with North Korea, amid revelations that the country was building a full-scale processing facility to produce plutonium.",
      "North Korea had kicked international inspectors out of the country in 1993, announcing its intention to pull out of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, an international agreement North Korea had joined in 1985.",
      "By then, the North Koreans had separated enough plutonium from spent fuel from a reactor it had built while Clinton was governor of Arkansas to create a couple of nuclear weapons, according to Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey.",
      "In October 1994, Clinton arranged a deal with incoming leader Kim Jong Il, whose father Kim Il Sung had died in July.",
      "North Korea would have to take its current reactor offline and stop construction of two other reactors they said were for electricity.",
      "In exchange, the United States would help the country build two so-called light-water nuclear reactors to produce power for the country. The light-water reactors would make it harder for North Korea to produce weapons-grade material. Those reactors were estimated to cost about $4 billion, and would be financed by South Korea, Japan, and possibly Germany, Russia and the United States, the Washington Post reported.",
      "In addition, the United States would help provide heavy fuel oil to North Korea, which would have to halt plans to produce nuclear weapons and submit to international inspections. It would have to surrender spent nuclear fuel once the new reactors were built.",
      "The deal, which did not require congressional approval, was referred to as the Agreed Framework. Clinton hailed it as a path to easing sanctions and normalizing diplomatic relations.",
      "\"This agreement will help achieve a longstanding and vital American objective an end to the threat of nuclear proliferation on the Korean Peninsula,\" Clinton said of the deal.",
      "Spoiler: The Agreed Framework failed.",
      "North Korea accelerated its efforts to enrich uranium, which wasn't a direct violation of the framework, and accused the United States of reneging on fuel oil promises. That certainly irked the George W. Bush administration, which cut off fuel oil shipments in 2002.",
      "North Korea withdrew from the agreement, ending its obligation to abide by the deal's terms. By 2006, North Korea claimed it had successfully tested a nuclear device.",
      "To say that Clinton's deal was the culprit is wrong, however.",
      "Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, said that while the Agreed Framework was flawed, it impeded North Korea's ambitions. The meme misrepresented much about the deal.",
      "\"This is a problem that is years in the making, owned by bipartisan administrations, and for a time, anyway delayed by President Clinton rather than him giving North Korea nuclear weapons,\" Nephew said.",
      "Importantly, Clinton didn't give North Korea two reactors, because the construction was never completed.",
      "You can even look up the unfinished sites online.",
      "And the $5 billion figure the viral image cited wasn't cash, but likely included the construction costs of the reactors (which were never completed) and energy aid. The Congressional Research Service noted in a 2014 report that the United States provided more than $400 million in heavy fuel oil to North Korea between 1995 and 2003.",
      "The consortium created to oversee the reactors' construction, the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, still exists on paper. It officially ended the light-water reactor project, but is still working \"to settle financial and legal obligations stemming from the termination.\"",
      "\"All the North Koreans got out of it in the end is that they stole the construction equipment\" for the reactors, Pollack said. \"They also learned a few things about building that type of reactor. They've tried to make a small initial one themselves, but it appears to have been stalled for years now.\"",
      "In the meantime, Pollack added, the North Koreans have created enough plutonium and enriched enough uranium to create as many as 60 nuclear bombs.",
      "",
      "An image circulating on the Internet claims \"Bill Clinton gave North Korea $5 billion and two nuclear reactors in 1994, essentially giving them nukes.\"",
      "Clinton did negotiate a deal in 1994 to provide two nuclear reactors and provide heavy fuel oil to North Korea in exchange for the country giving up its nuclear weapons program.",
      "That's about where the truth of this image stops. The energy aid costs didn't approach anywhere near $5 billion, and the reactors were never built. North Korea had continued to enrich uranium on its own, leading the Bush administration to end the deal. The agreement, while a failure, didn't give North Korea nuclear weapons. Experts said the agreement actually slowed North Korea down.",

      "President Donald Trump's supporters continue to back him because they felt so besieged by the political landscape and life in general that it's literally killing them, a GOP strategist said on ABC's This Week.",
      "Alex Castellanos, who has worked as a consultant for George W. Bush and Mitt Romney, said during an Aug. 20, 2017, discussion on the show that Trump's backers have stuck with him through controversies because they didn't see an alternative option. Democrats attacking Trump's response to violence in Charlottesville, Va., just fed into growing bitterness among his base over their dire socioeconomic situation, he said.",
      "\"What I think a lot of Trump supporters heard this week was, the Democrats are just painting us, Trump supporters, with a Nazi brush. We're all white supremacists. That's their excuse for why they lost the election,\" Castellanos said. \"No. White working-class America, death rates among white men are up 20 percent. They're unemployed. Gwen Ifill said, no wonder they're resentful.'\"",
      "We wondered about his statistic that working-class white men are dying at a higher rate than before. It turns out that researchers have identified increasing mortality among the white working class, but it's not as high for men as the 20 percent number Castellanos cited.",
      "In response to our questions, Castellanos sent us two articles from the New York Times and the Guardian about a 2015 paper by husband-and-wife Princeton economists Angus Deaton and Anne Case. Their research showed that death rates for middle-aged, white Americans had been going up, while they had been going down for every other age, race and ethnic group. Those rates also had been falling in other countries.",
      "This was a reversal of a years-long trend in which mortality rates had been steadily decreasing, meaning that Americans across many groups were living longer. From 1978 to 1998, white Americans were seeing mortality rates fall about 2 percent each year. So the fact that Case and Deaton found an increase was considered significant.",
      "But Deaton told us the 20 percent number Castellanos cited for men was too high. (That's a number the Guardian reported, but it cites the increase as being for \"the death rate for white Americans aged 45 to 54.\")",
      "\"In our 2015 PNAS paper, we say that for all white non-Hispanics (men and women together), mortality rates for those aged 45 to 54 rose at half of one percent per year, which from 1998 to 2013 is 7.8 percent, not 20 percent, and certainly not 20 percent for men only,\" Deaton wrote via email. Case added that that was for all levels of education, not just people who didn't have a college degree.",
      "Deaton and Case's study showed that mortality rates were climbing for white, non-Hispanic Americans aged 45 to 54 with a high school education or less. The research further showed that deaths were up from drug and alcohol poisonings, suicides, chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis. Mortality rates rose for all education groups, but \"those with less education saw the most marked increases,\" the paper read.",
      "It's important to note that overall mortality rates for African-Americans were still higher than whites. But African-Americans still recorded an overall drop in the same time period, not an increase.",
      "Researchers were surprised by the Case and Deaton study in 2015. Dartmouth economists Ellen Meara and Jonathan Skinner said in an analysis that while most Americans' life expectancies had gone up in the face of the Great Recession and rising income inequality, the study's findings \"dashed even this cautiously optimistic view of the past several decades.\"",
      "\"These trends are indeed concentrated among the least educated Americans who never attended college,\" Meara told PolitiFact. \"Of note, the trends do not apply to current retirees, nor youth, both groups that have experienced mortality improvements in recent decades.\"",
      "Others questioned the paper's results. Columbia University statistics professor Andrew Gelman argued that the situation wasn't as dire as it first appeared. He said that some statistical adjustments showed that middle-aged white women largely made up the difference in mortality rates, and the figures evened out when you combined men and women.",
      "Deaton and Case addressed some of these doubts in a 2017 follow-up to their paper. While the 2015 data didn't focus on differences between men and women, their latest work did, along with adjusting their age groups.",
      "\"For non-Hispanic white men aged 30 to 59 without a four-year college degree, age-adjusted all-cause mortality rose by 7 percent from 1998 to 2015,\" Deaton said of the latest data.",
      "Again they found that a lack of education was a major factor for increasing mortality rates, among other issues. (Gelman and Jonathan Auerbach, a Columbia doctoral student, again disputed their findings.)",
      "\"We propose a preliminary but plausible story in which cumulative disadvantage from one birth cohort to the next, in the labor market, in marriage and child outcomes, and in health, is triggered by progressively worsening labor market opportunities at the time of entry for whites with low levels of education,\" the 2017 paper read.",
      "There's evidence that whites with less education on the lower end of the income spectrum didn't make up the bulk of Trump's voters. The Washington Post reported that his base is largely affluent Republicans, whether they have a college education or not.",
      "Deaton said Castellanos was speaking too broadly, and the spirit of his comment misses what the research really says.",
      "\"To be fair, that mortality rates are going up at all is a big deal, and is a measure of the fact that bad things are happening to these people,\" he said.",
      "Castellanos said that for the white working class, \"death rates among white men are up 20 percent.\"",
      "Research has shown that death rates are up for white men, which is a cause for concern because death rates have historically declined. But that research is not without controversy. Also, the researchers who documented the increase in death rates say it's not as alarmingly high as 20 percent just for white men. A more accurate estimate would be around 7 percent.",

      "In an interview, Frum clarified that \"personal lifestyle costs\" excluded work trips, such as the G20 conference in Hamburg, Germany, or presidential residences where security costs are fixed, like the presidential retreat at Camp David.",
      "The pricey personal trips Frum had in mind include weekend trips to Trump-owned golf resorts in Palm Beach, Fla., Sterling, Va., and Bedminster, N.J.",
      "\"The Florida/Bedminster costs are entirely volitional, as are the costs of Melania's decision to live apart from her husband for most of his first year in office. There is no public purpose to any of those decisions,\" Frum told PolitiFact.",

      "Trump has left the White House more often at this point in his presidency than other modern presidents, according to CBS White House correspondent Mark Knoller, and the cost of protecting Trump while he's away is not cheap.",
      "Here's the important point to keep in mind: There are no definitive reports on the cost of Trump's travel, nor of any other president. The most comprehensive analyses exist on Trump and Obama's presidencies, and have been carried out by watchdog groups.",
      "The Government Accountability Office is the agency that traditionally computes costs for presidential travel, but its analysts have not calculated lifestyle costs for any president. Instead, they've looked into specific trips at Congress' request.",
      "The latest report looked at the cost of a four-day vacation President Barack Obama took to Palm Beach in February 2013. The trip cost approximately $3.6 million, and has formed the basis of much speculation on the cost of Trump's travel.",
      "Basing its estimates on that report, the liberal Center for American Progress' said that a trip to Mar-a-Lago costs taxpayers approximately $3.6 million, which we rated Half True.",
      "It's not precise to stick that price tag on every presidential trip, as costs vary depending on the size of the vehicles used and where they're flown in from. That trip included a stop in Obama's hometown of Chicago, and costs for Air Force One travel were also almost $60,000 higher per hour at the time, according to Judicial Watch, a conservative-leaning organization that has sued both Democratic and Republican administrations for public records.",
      "Using the $3.6 million estimate, the Center for American Progress placed Trump's personal travel costs through Aug. 3 at $32 million.",
      "That's a bit under a third of what Judicial Watch calculated Obama spent on personal travel in his eight years in office ($100 million).",
      "Judicial Watch offered a more conservative estimate for Trump.",
      "The watchdog group calculated the costs of five of Trump's and three of Melania's Mar-a-Lago visits and Vice President Mike Pence's Super Bowl trip in February using Air Force hourly travel rates obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. Those added up to a total of $3.6 million.",
      "That excludes, however, any of Trump's trips after March and security costs, as the Secret Service hasn't yet provided the data requested through the Freedom of Information Act. They also exclude other expenses, like $3.3 million in overtime costs Palm Beach County's presidential residence protection program incurred during Trump's visits.",
      "An internal agency document obtained by the Washington Post in March gives a better estimate of the amount spent on security by the Trump administration.",
      "The report said the Secret Service requested $60 million in additional funding for next year. $26.8 million would go to protecting Trump's family in Trump Tower and $33 million would fund travel costs. The Management and Budget Office had rejected the request.",
      "More recently, Secret Service Director Randolph Alles told USA Today that more than 1,000 agents have already hit the federally mandated annual caps for salary and overtime allowances.",
      "He attributed the dearth to both an unprecedented number of White House protectees -- Trump has 42, including his 18 family members, whereas Obama had 31 -- and efforts to secure Trump's multiple residences.",
      "Alles is in conversation with lawmakers to raise the cap from $160,000 per year to $187,000, but even that would leave 130 veteran agents without full compensation for hundreds of hours of work.",
      "Congress also had to approve compensation for 1,400 agents' thousands of hours of overtime that were earned above the limit in 2016.",
      "In the absence of concrete cost figures, we compared the president and the vice president's collective travel, measured loosely by the number of days logged by Secret Service agents protecting the vice president and president when they traveled. More agents worked travel days protecting Obama and Vice President Joe Biden at the six-month mark than Trump: 534 travel days to 378 for Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.",
      "But when we added the president and vice president's associated family members into the mix, agents had traveled 4,054 days protecting Trump to Obama's 1,621. That's in part because Trump has a larger family with adult children whose business ties take them all over the world.",
      "The 567 personnel assigned to the Office of Protective Operation are projected to exceed the pay cap in 2017, which put them on track to equal the total overtime hours worked in 2016.",
      "Frum said \"No president in history has imposed larger personal lifestyle costs on the taxpayer than Donald Trump.\"",
      "It's too early to call Trump's personal travel itinerary the costliest in presidential history, as he's only a few months into the job. It's also a bold claim to make in the absence of definitive data on the costs of presidential travel, which is generally not disclosed.",
      "Frum may nonetheless be onto something. Travel and security records we gathered suggest Trump is on pace to outstrip Obama's spending on security and transport costs. But it's still too soon to tell, and Frum's statement remains an exaggeration. We rate it Mostly False."

      "\"HIV virus detected in Walmart bananas after 10 year old boy contracts the virus,\" reads the headline on a post we first saw on Feb. 6, 2017, from a website called CNNews3.com. Facebook users flagged the story as part of the social media platform's efforts to stamp out fabricated news stories.",
      "The fake story, which is undated, said eight children younger than 17 had tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS in the month of March (it doesn't say in which year). All eight allegedly ate bananas purchased at a Tulsa, Okla., Walmart store, with the boy in the headline developing symptoms within a week. The text falsely says Walmart stores are recalling bananas nationwide.",
      "The post included a contrived photo (shown above) featuring a red-streaked banana. The screenshot is made to resemble a breaking news alert from CNN.",
      "But the website is not the real CNN, and there is no epidemic of HIV-infected bananas. The story is instead a symptom of a long-running online infection of fake news stories about disease-ridden fruit.",
      "CNNews3.com is filled with several obviously untrue posts about libidinous gorillas and dubious Big Mac ingredients made up to look like news reports, as well as other headlines that could be construed as real without any indication otherwise. The site's administrators did not answer our attempts to contact them, but it's obvious that CNNews3.com is attempting to masquerade as the cable news giant with a similar name.",
      "For the record, HIV can't survive outside the human body, so it's not possible for the virus to live in a fruit like a banana. The CNNews3.com tries to cast doubt on this by noting researchers were puzzled by the banana-borne infections.",
      "Here's what is true: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website that the virus cannot be spread by food. \"Even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus,\" the CDC says.",
      "This particular fake story is a variation on an Internet hoax that has been around for a few years. One version said the World Health Organization issued a warning about bananas being infected with HIV in India. Another said the South African government warned its citizens of a similar problem, then took down warnings to avoid a panic.",
      "This particular strain of the story can plausibly be traced back to one Facebook user's photos of red-streaked bananas in November 2015. User Anna Aquavia claimed that her friend's sister bought bananas in Nebraska that had been injected with HIV-positive blood.",
      "The photos are now gone, but you can see them at this Washington Post story. The Post credited the images to a Colorado woman named Amanda Andrys, who said Del Monte told her the red streaks were from a bacteria-induced disease called mokillo.",
      "Mokillo is more colorfully known as finger-tip rot, and can be a problem for banana growers. The disease doesn't harm humans, but it does require banana growers to disinfect farming equipment.",

      "Warren attempted to use the words of Coretta Scott King, the widow of slain civil rights hero Martin Luther King Jr., to smear Sen. Jeff Sessions' bid for Attorney General. Warren's now warrant-less claim was that King's wife's words framed Sessions as a bigot.",
      "But now a more recent video has surfaced where Coretta King in fact praises Sessions at the launching of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum.",
      "What a difference 12 hours can make.",
      "Several readers were curious about what the attached video showed, so we took a closer look. (True Pundit did not respond to an inquiry through its website.)",
      "The event in question was the Dec. 1, 2000, dedication of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum, located on the Montgomery, Ala., campus of Troy State University (since renamed Troy University). Parks had helped spark the civil rights movement in 1955 when she defied Alabama's Jim Crow racial laws by refusing to relinquish her seat in the front of a municipal bus in Montgomery.",
      "Speakers at the dedication included Parks herself; Coretta Scott King; civil rights widow Juanita Jones Abernathy; civil rights leaders Johnnie Mae Carr, Dorothy Height, Evelyn Lowery, Elaine Steele, Mammie Till-Mobley; actor Cicely Tyson; and several elected and appointed officials, including Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman, Montgomery mayor Bobby Bright, Troy State-Montgomery chancellor Jack Hawkins and president Cameron Martindale, U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, and Sessions.",
      "Here's a transcript of what King said on the YouTube video embedded in the website. A complete video of her address has been archived by C-SPAN, starting around the 1:06:44 mark.",
      "To President Martindale, to Sen. Sessions, Mayor Bright, Troy State Chancellor Jack Hawkins Jr., Dr. Dorothy Height, Ms. Johnnie Carr, Juanita Abernathy, Mammie Till-Mobley, to all of the distinguished program participants and guests in this audience today, it's a great honor and a privilege for me to join you in celebrating the grand opening of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum. History teaches us that all great freedom movements begin with an inspiring act of courage, and in this regard the American civil rights movement provides a supreme example. The library and museum we dedicate today is a living testament to the courage, commitment and character of the great woman whose act of courage sparked our freedom struggle, the woman we call Mrs. Rosa Louise Parks. In her extraordinary courage and humility, Mrs. Rosa Parks provided our movement with a matchless example of the very spirit of non-violence.",
      "That was the only time King mentioned Sessions in her speech -- and it her words fall well short of \"thanking\" him, whether for his role in establishing the library or for anything else. She simply acknowledged his presence in the room, as she did with other dignitaries.",
      "We checked with Jeff Shesol, a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton who is now a founding partner of West Wing Writers, which does speechwriting for a variety of clients.",
      "\"This is the verbal equivalent of a wave or a handshake,\" Shesol said. \"In speechwriting, we call this the acknowledgments' section -- a list of people that you simply have to mention, in passing, given their office or stature. The sort of people who you can't risk slighting by appearing to ignore them.\"",
      "Shesol said there is a separate category of salute that qualifies as a genuine thank you.",
      "\"When someone needs to be singled out and thanked for their role in something, or for their contribution or leadership, that requires the speaker to pause and say something grateful and meaningful,\" he said.",
      "And King did just that later in her speech, in a portion not shown in the YouTube clip that True Pundit appended to its post. In her remarks, King specifically thanked the Montgomery Improvement Association and Troy State University for their efforts on helping establish the library and museum.",

      "Fox News host Sean Hannity says it's no surprise that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against President Donald Trump and his executive order on immigration.",
      "\"We have both been predicting for days now the 9th Circuit the most liberal court of appeals, the most overturned court in the country it would act this way,\" Hannity said on his show Feb. 9, speaking with a guest.",
      "Several states have sued the Trump administration over its executive order that temporarily blocks immigration and travel from seven countries in the Middle East and Africa. A federal trial court judge in Seattle ruled Feb. 3 that the federal government could not enforce the executive order while the case is pending.",
      "So lawyers for the administration appealed that decision to the 9th Circuit, which hears cases from most of the western United States and Alaska and Hawaii. On Feb. 9, a panel of three judges ruled unanimously to affirm the Seattle judge's decision. (The court didn't rule on whether the executive order is legal. That will happen later.)",
      "It's possible the administration will try to appeal their case again, this time to the Supreme Court. Right after the judges handed down their decision, Trump tweeted, \"SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\"",
      "As Hannity noted, the 9th Circuit has a reputation for being liberal. But we wondered if he was correct when he said the Supreme Court overturns more cases from the 9th Circuit than any other appeals court in the country the implication being that the 9th Circuit is out of step with the Supreme Court.",
      "In our research, we found that the 9th Circuit has a higher-than-average reversal rate, but not the highest. Additionally, experts told us that counting reversals doesn't necessarily say much about the quality or substance of the 9th Circuit's work.",
      "The numbers",
      "To evaluate this claim, we turned to SCOTUSBlog's Supreme Court statistics archive, specifically their Circuit Scorecards, which track how often the Supreme Court justices agree or disagree with the lower court decisions.",
      "The Supreme Court hears cases from the 50 state courts and 13 federal appeals courts, known as circuit courts. The cases that the Supreme Court chooses to take on are often disputed among the lower courts, complex, and problematic, so there's a reasonable chance that the Supreme Court will decide that the lower court's decision was wrong.",
      "In fact, the Supreme Court reversed about 70 percent of cases it took between 2010-15. Among cases it reviewed from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, it reversed about 79 percent.",
      "The 9th Circuit's reversal rate is higher than average, but it's not the absolute highest among the circuit courts. That distinction goes to the 6th Circuit, which serves Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee, with an 87 percent average between 2010-15. The 9th Circuit is in third place.",
      "6th Circuit - 87 percent;",
      "11th Circuit - 85 percent;",
      "9th Circuit - 79 percent;",
      "3rd Circuit - 78 percent;",
      "2nd Circuit and Federal Circuit - 68 percent;",
      "8th Circuit - 67 percent;",
      "5th Circuit - 66 percent;",
      "7th Circuit - 48 percent;",
      "DC Circuit - 45 percent;",
      "1st Circuit and 4th Circuit - 43 percent;",
      "10th Circuit - 42 percent.",
      "We also found that the 9th Circuit never had the highest reversal rate in any individual term between 2004-15. (That's the farthest back we could go.)",
      "A spokesperson for Hannity pointed us to a 2014 article in National Review titled, \"Ninth Circuit Leading the Pack for Most Reversed.' \" But the evidence presented in the article does not support the headline.",
      "So Hannity's claim that the 9th Circuit is the \"most overturned court in the country\" is incorrect.",
      "The Supreme Court only hears a handful of cases from each circuit each year, so the rate of reversal is highly variable, said Jonah Gelbach, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a statistician. In 2014, for instance, the 2nd Circuit had a reversal rate of 100 percent, which sounds pretty bad until you find out that the Supreme Court only heard one case from the 2nd Circuit that entire season.",
      "The 9th Circuit is by far the largest circuit. In the 12 months leading up to March, 31, 2015, just under 12,000 cases were filed in the 9th Circuit more than 4,000 more than the next-largest circuit, the 5th Circuit. Despite that gigantic docket, the Supreme Court heard just 11 cases from the 9th Circuit in 2015, reversing eight.",
      "This means the Supreme Court generally reverses far less than 1 percent of all the cases the 9th Circuit (and other circuits) decide.",
      "\"Given the small numbers of cases involved, it can be difficult to draw any serious conclusions from such statistics about the quality of the courts involved,\" Gelbach said. \"Having said that, the 9th Circuit does seem to consistently have a high reversal rate over time.\"",
      "It's possible that the sheer size of the 9th Circuit, as well as some of its procedures, cause it to produce more \"outlier decisions,\" which are cases the Supreme Court always reverses, than other circuits leading to a higher reversal rate, said University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt.",
      "Roosevelt said there might have been a time in the past when the 9th Circuit was considerably more liberal than the Supreme Court, stemming from the fact that Democratic President Jimmy Carter didn't get the opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court justice, though he did appoint several judges to the 9th Circuit.",
      "Today, the 9th Circuit might still have the highest number of Democratic appointees of any appeals court, but there's been enough turnover in the past few decades that it's not as much of an outlier, Roosevelt said.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Hannity said the 9th Circuit is \"the most overturned court in the country.\"",
      "While the 9th Circuit has a higher than average reversal rate among cases it sends to the Supreme Court, it has not had the highest rate since at least 2004 (the oldest data point we could find).",
      "Even if it did, experts told us that the massive size of the 9th Circuit compared to the handful of cases it sends to the Supreme Court every year make reversal rates an imperfect measure of the quality of the 9th Circuit's decisions. More broadly, experts say this statistic is a poor way of comparing courts.",

      "We reached out to Fox News and did not hear back, but the network's personalities have used similar arguments before. We're not going to weigh in on whether Trump Jr. actually broke any laws, but we did wonder if there were laws that would apply to the idea of collusion.",
      "Legal scholars told us that the word \"collusion\" may not appear in statutes, but working with Russian officials could still violate criminal law.",
      "Daniel Lowenstein, law professor emeritus at UCLA, considered collusion a vague term that would describe \"some course of conduct that is adverse to someone else's interests,\" especially if it were being done in secret.",
      "\"It seems to me that what has been meant by collusion since this controversy began has been some agreement or understanding that the Russians would in some way assist Trump's electoral prospects and would be rewarded in some way by Trump as president acting favorably toward Russia,\" Lowenstein said. \"That would very likely be illegal and surely would be highly improper.\"",
      "Stanford University law professor Nathaniel Persily cited the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. A 2011 U.S. District Court ruling based on that law found that foreign nationals could not make expenditures \"to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a political candidate.\"",
      "\"A foreign national spending money to influence a federal election can be a crime,\" Persily said. \"And if a U.S. citizen coordinates, conspires or assists in that spending, then it could be a crime.\"",
      "The 2002 law enhanced penalties for violating statute for contributions and donations by foreign nationals that have been in effect since 1966, according to Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, a professor at the Stetson University College of Law. It's relevant if Trump Jr. thought he was getting information about Clinton.",
      "\"Since opposition research is typically something one would have to pay for, it is reasonable to consider opposition research a thing of value' under this statute,\" she said.",
      "University of Kentucky law professor Josh Douglas agreed that soliciting \"dirt\" on Clinton could arguably be considered valuable under federal law. He also said working with a foreign entity in a federal election could potentially be subject to public corruption or anti-coercion federal election law.",
      "John Coates, a Harvard University law professor, said that Russians looking to affect the election could potentially be defined as an expenditure. The related funds could be construed as an illegal contribution to a candidate who coordinates with the foreigner, he said.",
      "Discussions between a campaign and a foreigner could violate the law against fraud, Coates added.",
      "\"Under that statute, it is a federal crime to conspire with anyone, including a foreign government, to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services,' \" he said. \"That would include fixing a fraudulent election, in my view, within the plain meaning of the statute.\"",
      "University of California, Irvine law professor Rick Hasen said that in addition to possible violations of campaign finance and other federal laws, the Trump campaign could be open to another charge.",
      "\"If others participated in the scheme to do this it could be a conspiracy,\" Hasen said. \"Whether you want to call that collusion' or not seems besides the point.\"",
      "Bolling said \"collusion is not illegal.\"",
      "Legal scholars told us the word \"collusion\" is vague and may not be specifically used in legal language. But conduct that may be described as collusion could potentially be subject to multiple federal laws, including statutes on foreign contributions to elections and fraud.",

As of 2013, it said, bin Laden is living with \"five of his wives and many children\" collecting more than $100,000 a month via a Nassau bank account.",

As a commenter on the Reddit thread noted, GovTrack.us notes Waters has missed 7.6 percent of her votes since January 1991. That's higher than the 2.2 percent average among all House members, but nowhere near a 90 percent absentee rate.",

      "Proposed changes to Medicaid shouldn't worry people currently using the health care program for the very poor, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said, because their coverage will continue.",
      "Conway and George Stephanopoulos discussed the GOP's health care plans on ABC's This Week on June 25, 2017. Senate Republicans earlier in the week had released a bill to follow up the House plan passed in May.",
      "Despite a projected $800 billion in cuts to the joint state and federal program which Conway characterized not as cuts but as \"getting Medicaid back to where it was\" current enrollees would not be affected, she said.",
      "\"If you are currently in Medicaid, if you became a Medicaid recipient through the Obamacare expansion, you are grandfathered in,\" Conway said.",
      "We reached out to the White House to try to get more details on Conway's statement, but did not get a response.",
      "Conway appears to be talking about a provision in the House version of the bill that doesn't appear in the Senate version. In either scenario, however, experts say current Medicaid enrollees will be in danger of losing funding and benefits.",
      "First, let's review the Medicaid expansion and how it's funded.",
      "As part of its efforts to obtain health coverage for as many people as possible, the Affordable Care Act allowed states to expand Medicaid and help pay for it with more federal dollars. Thirty-one states plus D.C. currently have extended Medicaid benefits to all adults making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The poverty line for a family of four is $24,600 in 2017.",
      "For states with expanded Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act said the federal government would cover 90 percent or more of the cost of newly eligible Medicaid recipients. The money Washington kicks in to cover those patients is called the federal match rate.",
      "The House bill would lower the federal match rate for new Medicaid applicants, back to the pre-Obamacare rate, which depends on the state, but would average about 57 percent by 2020. That would shift more costs of expanded Medicaid to states, and almost assuredly result in drastic changes to state programs.",
      "\"In practice, this means tens of billions of dollars cut from the Medicaid expansion, and most states wouldn't be able to cover that gap, so they'd have to reduce eligibility, benefits or both,\" said Ben Sommers, a Harvard University health policy and economics professor.",
      "Some states even would mandate changes by law.",
      "Seven \"trigger\" states Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Washington built requirements into their Medicaid expansions to protect them from the higher costs of covering so many more people. Those states would legally have to end or curb the expansion if the federal match rate goes down.",
      "Bottom line, while the House bill would allow for an expanded Medicaid system to continue, GOP lawmakers would put less money into it and allow individual states to change eligibility requirements.",
      "The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said in February 2017 that about 2.6 million expansion-eligible adults would lose coverage due to these trigger laws.",
      "The House bill does allow people covered by expanded Medicaid as of Dec. 31, 2019, to continue to qualify for the higher 90 percent federal match rate under Obamacare. The \"grandfathered expansion enrollees\" would have to maintain near-continuous coverage, with no breaks of more than a month, in order to get the higher rate.",
      "That's not as simple as it sounds.",
      "Continuous coverage can be hard for Medicaid recipients to maintain. Medicaid patients have to continuously provide proof of income, and if a patient goes over the income limit, they lose coverage. This is a concept known as churning.",
      "Joan Alker, a public policy professor and executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University, said that even if the bill grandfathers in those people at Obamacare funding levels, there's no guarantee they'll be able to keep their Medicaid benefits.",
      "\"After a few years ... it is estimated that those people will mostly all have churned off, effectively ending that protection,\" Alker said.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office detailed what would happen in a March analysis of the House plan.",
      "The CBO concluded \"that fewer than one-third of those enrolled as of December 31, 2019, would have maintained continuous eligibility two years later.\" If the bill became law, the higher federal match rate would still apply to less than 5 percent of newly eligible enrollees by 2024, the CBO estimated.",
      "That would be translate to about 550,000 of the roughly 11 million enrollees who now qualify for the enhanced federal matching under Medicaid expansion.",
      "\"Even under the ACA, Medicaid is income sensitive and it is typical for people other than the elderly and people with disabilities to cycle on and off,\" said Sara Rosenbaum, a George Washington University health law and policy professor. \"Under neither the House nor Senate bill are current expansion beneficiaries guaranteed any coverage duration.\"",
      "The Senate bill, meanwhile, continues to fund Medicaid expansion at the same rates until 2020. After that, the federal contribution shrinks to 85 percent in 2021, 80 percent in 2022 and 75 percent in 2023. In 2024, the federal reimbursement rate drops to the current average of around 57 percent. For states to maintain the Medicaid expansion as is, states would have to raise spending by $43 billion in 2024 alone, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Conway said, \"If you became a Medicaid recipient through the Obamacare expansion, you are grandfathered in.\"",
      "The GOP health care bill that passed the House, along with the \"discussion draft\" circulated in the Senate, make changes to Medicaid for people who acquired health care coverage through Obamacare.",
      "The House proposal includes a grandfather clause that allows people covered by expanded Medicaid as of Dec. 31, 2019, to continue to qualify for a 90 percent federal match rate. But the \"grandfathered expansion enrollees\" would have to maintain near-continuous coverage in order to get the higher rate. Experts say that is extremely difficult because of changes in income or because of changes states could choose to make.",
      "The Senate plan, which remains just a draft, continues the Medicaid expansion program largely as is until 2020, before beginning to reduce federal funding for all enrollees. That means either states will have to pick up a larger share of the cost or make changes to the program.",
      "In either scenario, changes are likely. It's just a matter of when and how.",

      "\"It is in a death spiral,\" conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt said March 26 on Meet the Press. \"The New York Times yesterday pointed out that the president of Aetna that you will lose coverage in many places in America for everyone, and that to me is a death spiral for those people.\"",

      "We reached out to Hewitt through his radio program but did not hear back.",
      "Still no death spiral'",
      "\"Death spiral\" is a health industry term built around three components:",
      "Shrinking enrollment;",
      "Healthy people leaving the system;",
      "Rising premiums.",
      "Specifically, a death spiral occurs when shrinking enrollment leads to a deteriorating risk pool (or when healthy people leave the plan due to the cost). That leads to higher premiums for the people remaining in the insurance pools, which causes enrollment to shrink even further, continuing the cycle until the entire system fails.",
      "The latest government figures show enrollment in the Affordable Care Act is slightly down from last year. Through Jan. 31, 2017, some 12.2 million people were signed up for coverage through a federal or state marketplace, which is a decrease of 500,000, or 4 percent, from the same point last year.",
      "Experts noted that marketplace sign-ups were running in line with their 2016 pace as of the middle of January, which experts said might suggest the decline in sign-ups was somehow related to the Trump administration, not an impending death spiral.",
      "For example, the Trump administration decided to at least partially halt marketing and outreach encouraging people to sign up for health coverage.",
      "But experts say the enrollment decline isn't an indication the health care law is in a death spiral. There is no direct connection, they said, showing that the declining enrollment is causing premiums to increase.",
      "Why not? Because federal government subsidies in the form of tax credits are largely shielding customers from feeling the premium increase.",
      "As we have reported, premiums are increasing. But that isn't affecting the cost for most consumers, due to built-in subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. The subsidies cap premium prices at a certain percentage of income for anyone below 400 percent of the federal poverty level (in 2016 that would be $47,520 for a single person).",
      "Among the people who have signed up so far for 2017, 81 percent will receive a subsidy.",
      "Data also shows no uptick in healthy people leaving the health insurance market.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reports the share of people signing up for health care in the low-risk demographic ages 18-34 remains about the same in 2017 as it was in 2016, at 26 percent of enrollees.",
      "\"There is no data to indicate a drop in the number of younger enrolled, although the announced policy not to enforce the IRS penalty, if not reversed, could result in a decline over time,\" said John Rother, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care.",
      "Hewitt referred to a New York Times article that quotes the president of Aetna saying that in many places people will lose health care insurance.",
      "We couldn't find that article, but a simple remark on how premiums are rising and insurers are leaving the marketplace is not enough evidence to meet the actuarial definition of a death spiral.",
      "CBO, independent analysis: No death spiral",
      "Others have also concluded that the Affordable Care Act is not in a death spiral. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, as part of its recent analysis of the GOP legislation, described the Affordable Care Act as stable.",
      "Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy at the Brookings Institution, similarly concluded in a recent analysis that the Affordable Care Act is not in a death spiral.",
      "Fiedler found that marketplace premium increases had little if any impact on health insurance sign-ups and that the impact on the individual market risk pool will more than likely be minor, despite the small decline in enrollment numbers.",

      "Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network's efforts to curb fake news. Similar headlines appeared on several other links that users questioned.",
      "The post claimed that while the \"liberal media\" is attacking President Donald Trump's response to the humanitarian crisis, the real issue is that \"the Teamsters Union drivers did not show up to work. Only 20 percent of drivers arrived at the ports to distribute the relief supplies,\" The Gateway Pundit said.",
      "The other posts all shared the same sentiment, and often included \"proof\" from more social media posts claiming to know all about the problem.",
      "But they aren't right to blame union truckers for the lack of movement. It turns out the blog posts are delivering misinformation about this problem.",
      "The Gateway Pundit pointed to another Sept. 30 post from TheConservativeTreehouse.com, which cited a Sept. 29 Huffington Post interview with U.S. Air Force Col. Michael A. Valle. Valle was born in Puerto Rico and was leading Maria relief efforts.",
      "The Conservative Treehouse post included a passage from the interview that said supplies are being sent to Puerto Rico, but not being moved across the island.",
      "\"It's a lack of drivers for the transport trucks, the 18 wheelers,\" the website quoted Valle as saying. \"Supplies we have. Trucks we have. There are ships full of supplies, backed up in the ports, waiting to have a vehicle to unload into. However, only 20 percent of the truck drivers show up to work. These are private citizens in Puerto Rico, paid by companies that are contracted by the government.\"",
      "Valle did say in the Huffington Post interview that there was a lack of drivers, but he also went on to add the drivers deserved \"zero blame:\"",
      "\"They can't get to work, the infrastructure is destroyed, they can't get fuel themselves, and they can't call us for help because there's no communication. The will of the people of Puerto Rico is off the charts. The truck drivers have families to take care of, many of them have no food or water. They have to take care of their family's needs before they go off to work, and once they do go, they can't call home.\"",
      "The Conservative Treehouse also posted a video of CNBC's Contessa Brewer reporting from San Juan as proof of the problem, but ignored the part where Brewer said transportation problems are not the drivers' fault.",
      "\"You're looking at truck drivers who can't be reached by their businesses by cell phone, they don't have the gas to get to work, and then even when they do get to work, their semi-trucks don't have fuel,\" Brewer said. \"The problem is the supply chain.\"",
      "She added that Crowley Puerto Rico, a shipping and logistics company, said that getting drivers to the port and back out again was proving to be a challenge.",
      "There has been a definite problem moving supplies that have arrived. On Sept. 29, the same day Valle's interview was published, the Teamsters sent out a press release asking union truck drivers to volunteer to go to Puerto Rico to help transport supplies. The release warned that it wouldn't be easy, but fellow union workers needed help.",
      "\"At this time, it is unclear if there are trucks available to move the containers, fuel to operate the trucks or road access to the distribution centers,\" the release read. \"However, the labor movement is working on the ground in Puerto Rico to bring volunteers to meet specific needs.\"",
      "There's no mention of strike in the press release, and nothing in Valle's interview about labor unions, so where did the The Conservative Treehouse get that? From an interview with a trucker not affiliated with the Teamsters union.",
      "The blog turned to a Spanish-language interview for Lo S Todo on Wapa.tv with Victor Rodriguez, identifying as \"the boss of a very sketchy (corrupt and violent) Puerto Rico trucker's union called Fente Amplio.\"",
      "Dozens of subsequent posts online identify Frente Amplio (note the different spelling) as the local Teamsters union, which Teamsters spokesman Galen Munroe told us is incorrect. Rodriguez represents the independent Frente Amplio de Camioneros de Puerto Rico (Broad Front of Truck Drivers of Puerto Rico), which is not affiliated with the Teamsters.",
      "TheConservativeTreehouse.com egregiously misrepresented Rodriguez's interview, translating it to claim that Rodriguez said truck drivers are refusing to work as part of a plan to show up Puerto Rico's governor.",
      "\"Since the country doesn't care about truckers, the truckers won't help,\" TheConservativeTreehouse.com quoted Rodriguez. It credits the reporter with getting Rodriguez to admit his defiance.",
      "In truth, Rodriguez is saying the opposite, that despite a disagreement over a law signed by Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rossell concerning truck permitting, drivers should help in any way they can. Truckers called off a planned strike because of Hurricane Irma three weeks prior, he said.",
      "Rodriguez did take a swipe at Rossell , saying long lines are partly his fault, and noted that truckers can't come down when they are in regions with impassable roads. But by and large, Rodriguez said that truckers are working and doing what they need to do to deliver goods. He even cuts off the reporter at one point for suggesting they are refusing to work.",
      "In response to all the false stories online blaming Teamster drivers, the union released a statement on Oct. 2 that said their members have been working since Maria passed over the island. The statement blamed \"online, anti-union sources\" for spreading an inaccurate story.",
      "\"These viral stories spreading across the internet are nothing but lies perpetrated by anti-union entities to further their destructive agenda,\" Teamsters president Jim Hoffa said in the release. \"The fact that they are attempting to capitalize on the suffering of millions of citizens in Puerto Rico that are (in) dire need of our help by pushing these false stories, just exposes their true nature.\"",
      "Bloggers said that \"San Juan Teamsters didn't show up for work to distribute relief supplies\" because they went on strike after Hurricane Maria.",
      "The widespread accusations trace back to a post that selectively edited and mistranslated interviews to make it look like union truckers were being greedy and lazy.",
      "But there's no strike, and union truck drivers have been trying to move aid shipments across Puerto Rico. There are multiple logistical problems slowing down transport, not the least of which is that some drivers simply can't get to the port, or drive on impassable roads.",

      "As details about the Las Vegas shooter's identity emerged, media outlets noted some of the characteristics fit neatly within a familiar profile of prior mass shooting perpetrators.",
      "Newsweek, for instance, ran a story with the headline, \"White men have committed more mass shootings than any other group.\" The article builds on this claim, stating that 54 percent of mass shootings carried out since 1982 were done so by white males.",
      "We've covered the demographics of mass shootings before but had not heard this specific claim. So we decided to take a closer look at who's behind mass shootings.",
      "No U.S. government entity specifically tracks mass shootings much less, the shooters' race and ethnicity, experts told us. But some media organizations and nongovernmental groups have taken up the task in various forms.",
      "Some of the differences in the datasets are the result of having no universally accepted definition of mass shooting. The number of mass shootings a group tallies can vary dramatically based on how the term is defined.",
      "For example, the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit organization that tracks gun-related injuries and deaths, defines a mass shooting as \"four or more shot and/or killed in a single incident, at the same general time and location, not including the shooter.\" According to that group, there have been 274 mass shootings so far this year, or nearly one per day.",
      "Another widely cited source comes from the progressive media outlet Mother Jones, which created a database in 2012 after the mass shooting at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater.",
      "Mother Jones defines a public mass shooting as an incident in which the motive appeared to be indiscriminate killing and a lone gunman took the lives of at least three people. This language is similar to a 2013 statute that defines \"mass killings\" as three or more killed in a single incident, though that applies to any weapon.",
      "The Mother Jones database, which dates back to Aug. 20, 1982, counts 91 mass shootings. Of these, 50 were carried out by white men hence, where Newsweek and other outlets got the statistic that 54 percent of mass shootings carried out since 1982 were done so by white men.",
      "For comparison's sake, Mother Jones' data show African-Americans accounted for 15 mass shootings, while Latinos and Asians were responsible for seven each. Three attacks were carried out by women, including one of the two perpetrators behind the 2015 San Bernardino shooting.",
      "We should note that some experts expressed concern that if the public debate around gun violence focuses too much on mass shootings, there's a risk of overlooking the fact that gun murders disproportionately affect minorities, especially African-Americans.",
      "Because Newsweek's claim derives from Mother Jones' data, we asked experts about the reliability of this count.",
      "Grant Duwe, author of Mass Murder in the United States: A History, considered a leading scholarly book on the subject, has long criticized Mother Jones' accounting.",
      "Duwe pointed us to an essay he penned for Reason magazine in 2014, in which he argued Mother Jones has low-balled its tally of mass shootings as a result of relying solely on news coverage as its source of data. Duwe believes this creates a false impression that mass shootings have been on the rise (a claim that's beyond the scope of this fact-check).",
      "\"The main concern is an underreporting problem that gets worse the farther back in time we go,\" Duwe told PolitiFact. \"This creates problems when it comes to drawing conclusions about trends in the prevalence of mass public shootings.\"",
      "Nevertheless, Duwe said his own research dating back to 1900 corroborates that white men have committed more mass shootings than any other group, though he believes white men make up an even larger share than the Mother Jones data show.",
      "\"There have been at least 184 mass public shootings in the U.S. since 1900, including the Las Vegas attack,\" Duwe said. \"Among these mass public shooters, non-Hispanic whites make up 63 percent, which is close to what we see for the U.S. population in general. So, the Mother Jones data actually underreport the extent to which whites are involved as mass public shooters.\"",
      "The vast majority of mass shootings is committed by men.",
      "Looking only at the male population, some have argued that statistical claims based on Mother Jones data on the racial makeup of mass shooters leaves out important context. Critics argue that when you consider that non-Hispanic white men make up about 63 percent of the male population, white men appear proportionally less likely to commit a mass shooting, according to the Mother Jones statistics showing white men account for 54 percent of mass shootings. (Duwe's finding that non-Hispanic white men make up 63 percent of mass shooters is roughly in line with the white portion of the male population. White men make up roughly 31 percent of the overall U.S. population.)",
      "Duwe defines \"mass public shooting\" as an incident that occurs in the absence of other criminal activity, in which a gun was used to kill four or more victims at a public location within a 24-hour period.",
      "Mother Jones national affairs editor Mark Follman praised Duwe's dataset as valuable, but he pushed back on the notion that they'd underreported attacks, saying that to the best of his recollection some of the shootings Duwe flagged as deserving to be included in Mother Jones' database did not fit their criteria.",
      "He also said that while most of Mother Jones' data is initially culled from media reports, they have also relied on primary source documents, interviews with law enforcement and tips from the public about more obscure cases going back further in time. For more on how the group calculated the frequency of mass shootings, he pointed us to a 2014 Mother Jones article claiming the rate of mass shootings tripled since 2011.",
      "Newsweek said, \"White men have committed more mass shootings than any other group.\"",
      "Newsweek based its claim on data from Mother Jones, which defines a public mass shooting as an incident in which the motive appeared to be indiscriminate killing and a lone gunman took the lives of at least three people. Under this definition, Mother Jones found that non-Hispanic white men have been responsible for 54 percent of mass shootings since August 1982.",
      "Another tally, with a longer timeline and a different definition of mass shooting, found non-Hispanic white men make up 63 percent of these attacks. Under both definitions and datasets, white men have committed more mass shootings than any other ethnicity group.",
      "Newsweek's claim is literally accurate. But it's worth noting the imprecision of this data, and the percentage of mass shootings by white men is lower than their share of the male population, according to Mother Jones.",

      "Climate change doubters have no patience for claims that the overwhelming number of climate researchers believe that humans are the driving factor. Facebook users flagged a recent article on the website News Punch that asserted much more disagreement in the scientific community than is commonly thought.",
      "\"30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money,\" was the subheadline in the Sept. 2 story.",
      "That striking number of dissenting scientists has been around for many years and dates back to a 1998 petition drive conducted under the auspices of a climate change skeptic named Arthur Robinson. Robinson is a biochemist, conservative activist and four-time Republican congressional candidate in Oregon. Robinson believes human-driven climate change is a myth.",
      "Robinson's Petition Project now counts 31,487 signatories. Before we get to who those people are, the key flaw in the News Punch statement is that the petition doesn't say what the article claims. Here's what people sign:",
      "",
      "For the purposes of this fact-check, the key sentence is, \"There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate.\"",
      "The petition says nothing about hoaxes or profit motives.",
      "On its face, someone signing the petition need not believe that climate change is a hoax, nor that it has been perpetrated to make money. While some or even many who signed it might hold those beliefs, the petition itself doesn't speak to either of those conditions.",
      "In terms of the mindset of the signers, the statement relies on speculation.",
      "There are many reasons to question what it means to have over 31,000 people signing this petition.",
      "First of all, the meaning of \"scientist\" is vague. The minimum requirement is a bachelor's of science degree. That's no guarantee that the person studied a science related to climate change, or that the person pursued a career in science. The petition's website says that 12,715 signers hold \"BS or equivalent academic degrees.\"",
      "When we look at the number of people with some sort of background in fields that tie directly to climate change, the petition website said, \"there are 3,805 scientists trained in specialties directly related to the physical environment of the Earth.\"",
      "That would be about 12 percent of the total.",
      "There are, according to the site, 9,029 people with PhDs, which comes closer to meeting a higher bar for being thought of as a scientist. Based on the site's figures, most of them don't specialize in climate change, but they likely are more familiar with scientific methods.",
      "These important nuances get lost. A 2012 opinion piece in Forbes described the signers as \"more than 31,000 American scientists from diverse climate-related disciplines.\"",
      "That's way off the mark, unless you count veterinarians -- one of the degrees that qualifies you as a scientist in the petition project -- and physicians.",
      "We also don't know much about when people signed the petition. The website tells us that thousands of signatures came in 1998 and 1999 when the petition was first circulated. It also says, \"The majority of the current listed signatories signed or re-signed the petition after October 2007.\"",
      "The problem is, the scientific consensus on mankind's role in climate change has grown over time. Even if more than half of the signers came after that date, it doesn't mean that those who came before remain skeptical of climate change.",
      "There's reason to think that opinions can shift. When the magazine Scientific American reached out to a random sample of 30 names on the list in 2006, it found \"six said they would not sign the petition today, three did not remember any such petition, one had died, and five did not answer.\"",
      "We reached out to the publishers of News Punch and did not hear back.",
      "An article on the News Punch website said that \"30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money.\" The source is a well-known petition project.",
      "The key flaw is that the petition challenges the science, but it doesn't cast human-driven climate change as a hoax aimed at making some people rich. That is pure interpretation by the website.",
      "The use of the word \"scientists\" is misleading, since a signatory need not be a scientist today and need not have done more than earned a bachelor of science degree in any field. The actual number of climate-related specialists is about 12 percent of the total. And these are not currently confirmed signatories as the list has been circulating since 1998.",
      "For all these reasons, we rate this claim Pants on Fire."

      "The celebrities were not calling for a strike barring Trump's resignation.",
      "O'Donnell told NBC Late Night host Seth Meyers in November 2017 that she has been in a \"severe depression\" since Trump won the presidency and that she spends \"90 percent of my waking hours tweeting hatred towards\" Trump.",
      "The pair have bad blood going back to O'Donnell's time on ABC's The View, when she criticized Trump on multiple personal and professional fronts after his decision not to fire a Miss USA accused of drug use and other wrongdoing.",

I read all of my messages. #LoveTrumpsHate #ResistTrump Please don't leave hateful comments or memes on my page. Stay Rosie.\"",
      "So Nourtey.com said, \"Hollywood celebs: We will go on total strike' if Trump does not resign.\" While O'Donnell was among the celebrities who signed a Refuse Fascism petition calling for protests leading up to Trump's inauguration and has continued to criticize Trump, we found no evidence that there was a plan for a mass strike among celebrities.

      "Several news websites have reported that the investigation of wrongdoing involving Uranium One and Hillary Clinton bagged its first indictment.",
      "Facebook users flagged a post from a site called Republican News as suspicious and possibly fake. The website's Jan. 13 headline said, \"First indictment issued in Russian bribery case tied to Obama-era Uranium One deal.\"",
      "That post echoed similar reporting by the New York Post, which announced \"there's an indictment in the FBI probe of the Uranium One scandal,\" also on Jan. 13. The next day, The Hill repeated the Post report.",
      "There was an indictment, but the Justice Department doesn't tie it to the Uranium One deal.",
      "Instead, the charges come out of a 2014 investigation of an American-based kickback scheme that defrauded millions of dollars from a subsidiary of the Russian nuclear agency Rosatom.",
      "The kickback scheme and Rosatom's 2010 purchase of a controlling interest in the Canadian company Uranium One were entirely separate. The kickback plan locked in contracts for an American firm to import Russian uranium. The other deal involved buying Uranium One stock. They involved different Rosatom subsidiaries and different activities.",
      "The news reports tied the two together, but none gave details on the connection.",
      "\"The DOJ handed down an indictment in the Uranium One deal,\" Republican News said. \"THIS is what the media was trying so hard to cover-up.\"",
      "But it provided no evidence.",
      "Let's unpack this.",
      "Mark Lambert is the former co-president of Transport Logistics International, a Maryland company that arranged the transport of nuclear materials to the United States. According to the Jan. 12 indictment, between at least as early as 2009 and 2014, Lambert and his partner funneled money to a Russian official with Tenex, the company in charge of exporting Russian uranium.",
      "Through an elaborate kickback scheme, the Maryland firm got the contracts to ship Russian uranium to the United States. Tenex paid handsomely for the firm's services, and the Maryland firm shared some of the proceeds with the Russian official. In short, Tenex paid for the bribery.",
      "Lambert's indictment on Jan. 12, 2018, was just the most recent step in a long-running case against his company. That investigation made no mention of Uranium One.",
      "In 2014, the Justice Department charged Lambert's business partner, the Russian Tenex official and two others (including the wife of the business partner) with bribery, fraud and money laundering. All told, about $2.1 million ended up in overseas bank accounts controlled by the Russian.",
      "For the record, the indictment of the Russian official said the scheme started in 2004. That's six years before the Uranium One sale was on the table.",
      "Lambert's business partner and the Russian had pled guilty in 2015. The Russian is serving a two-year prison term, and the business partner is awaiting sentencing.",
      "In 2010, the Russian nuclear agency Rosatom wanted to become the majority owner of the Canadian firm Uranium One. Uranium One had holdings in the United States, so the deal had to win approval by a number of state and federal agencies. That group included the State Department, then led by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.",
      "Our summary of the case gives plenty of details, but the gist is some of the owners of Uranium One had given millions to the Clinton Foundation. One in particular gave the foundation between $1.3 million and $5.6 million while the sale was under review.",
      "On the 2016 campaign trail, candidate Donald Trump cast the donations as a payoff to grease the skids for approval.",
      "There is no evidence that Clinton had a hand in the vetting process, an undertaking that involved eight federal offices in addition to the State Department.",
      "Recently, Republicans have called for a fresh investigation of the matter. The Justice Department has made no official comment.",
      "The department recently allowed an FBI informant in the Tenex bribery case to testify before a Senate committee investigating the Uranium One transaction. It is unknown what if anything new that informant might provide.",
      "How does the recent indictment link to the Uranium One sale? Aside from the tie to Rosatom, not in any obvious way.",
      "The Maryland firm was in cahoots with Vadim Mikerin, a Russian national who was the general director of Tenam USA, the American arm of Tenex. Tenex is a subsidiary of JSC Atomenergoprom, which in turn is a subsidiary of Rosatom.",
      "Rosatom bought the controlling share in Uranium One through another subsidiary.",
      "There is no evidence that the kickback scheme that defrauded Tenex overlapped with Rosatom's efforts to buy Uranium One. None of the news reports that claimed a connection provided any evidence. In fact, the New York Post article incorrectly said, \"The federal investigation grew from charges that the Obama administration covered up an FBI probe of the uranium business and thus allowed the Russian firm Tenex to buy a stake in Uranium One.\"",
      "But Tenex was not the buyer. As a subsidiary of Rosatom, its role was to export Russian uranium, a very different business activity. The Rosatom subsidiary that bought the stake in Uranium One was Atomredmetzoloto.",
      "Law professor Michael Koehler at Southern Illinois University School of Law is an expert on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has written about the Tenex prosecutions. He reviewed the indictment and saw no tie between the two matters.",
      "\"Last week's case concerns the same core conduct the Justice Department brought action on in June 2015,\" Koehler said.",
      "While any FBI investigation of the Uranium One deal lies behind a veil of secrecy at the department, Koehler said the idea that it might have spurred the latest indictment is \"highly unlikely.\"",
      "A website called Republican News said a recent bribery indictment is tied to the Uranium One deal. There was an indictment, but the Justice Department did not connect it to the sale of shares of Uranium One to Rosatom.",
      "The indictment was the latest step in a 2014 investigation of a kickback scheme that defrauded a Rosatom subsidiary. That investigation had already secured two guilty pleas.",
      "The reports that tied the indictment to Uranium One offered no evidence of a connection.",

    "body-image": [],
    "body-text": [
      "During House floor debate on this year's most prominent abortion bill in the General Assembly, Rep. Matthew Hill declared that one reason enactment is needed is that physicians are currently flying into the state and then flying out, leaving their patients with little recourse should complications arise. The bill (HB3808) requires abortion providers to have hospital admission privileges in the county where the procedure is performed or an adjacent county. Critics contended the bill, titled \"The Life Defense Act of 2012,\" is unnecessary and intended as an impediment to providing abortions in Tennessee. Hill, R-Jonesborough, is vice chairman of the House Health and Human Resources Committee, chairman of the House Health Subcommittee and lead sponsor of the bill. In explaining why passage is needed, he told colleagues in the March 29, 2012, floor debate that, first of all, abortion doctors were traveling across the state to perform abortions and then going back home. That's not the claim we're checking; his second reason is what brought forth skepticism from his colleagues. \"Number two,\" Hill said, \"we have abortion physicians that are flying into this state and that they are performing abortions.\" He continued: \"They're flying into this state, performing abortions and flying out. And what happens is when a woman has complications, the doctor who performed that abortion is long gone. So if anything -- and I know it's true this legislation will expand critical, possibly life-saving access to care to the woman who has complications from the abortion. That's why I'm bringing the legislation and that, in all practicality, is what it'll do.\" Hill's assertion about doctors flying in from out of the state was challenged by House Democratic Caucus Chairman Mike Turner of Nashville. Turner first asked, \"How many doctors are flying in and performing abortions?\" Replied Hill: \"I don't have the exact number. You can probably call Planned Parenthood if you like.\" Turner pressed the point, asking if \"you know any place this is happening.\" Hill: \"I do know of one physician that is driving from Northeast Tennessee across the state of Tennessee to do this.\" Turner: \"But you said out-of-state You don't know that for sure?\" Hill: \"I do not have direct knowledge of that, no, sir.\" That left hanging the question of whether there actually are abortion doctors flying into the state, performing the procedures, then flying away. We decided to seek the answer. Bill Christian, spokesman for the state Department of Health, said that a physician performing an abortion in Tennessee must be licensed to practice medicine within the state under current law. But that does not mean the physician has to be a Tennessee resident. It would be legal, he said, for a non-resident doctor to fly into Tennessee and perform an abortion so long as he or she was licensed within the state. Christian said the department has no information on whether any doctors are doing so and no indication of any doctor being prosecuted for performing an abortion without a license in the state. But the statistics collected by the department on abortions would not necessarily cover that information, he said. Hill, asked for his source for the assertion, said he had been told of fly-in doctors by leaders of Tennessee Right to Life, an organization of anti-abortion activists. Brian Harris, president of Tennessee Right to Life, said he believes there are cases of fly-in abortion providers, but declined to provide any specifics because of \"circumstances now evolving on another front.\" \"All around the country, I don't think it's an unusual practice,\" said Harris, adding that the practice may increase because the number of abortion providers is declining nationwide. Harris said there is at least one case of the reverse situation a Tennessee doctor flying out of the state to perform abortions. He cited Dr. Gary Boyle of Blountville, who was arrested in October, 2010, on charges of pointing a gun at anti-abortion protesters outside a clinic in Charleston, S.C. Boyle has pleaded not guilty to the charges and the trial is still pending. And former state Rep. Chris Clem, an attorney in Chattanooga, says there was a lawsuit filed years ago against two Alabama doctors alleging malpractice in an abortion performed at a now-closed Chattanooga clinic. But Clem could not provide the doctors' names or any details of the case, which he recalls was settled out of court more than a decade ago. On the other hand, leaders with Planned Parenthood in Tennessee say Hill's claim is blatantly wrong. \"That has never happened,\" said Jeff Teague, CEO and president of Planned Parenthood of Middle and East Tennessee. \"All the doctors we use (in Planned Parenthood clinics) are from Tennessee and, from conversations with others (who provide abortion services in the state), they have Tennessee physicians, too.\" Planned Parenthood has two regional offices in Tennessee. Barry Chase of the Greater Memphis office, concurs with Teague: \"Rep. Hill needs to find out what the truth is and stick with it in the future.\" Teague said that Hill's reference to calling Planned Parenthood during the debate is an example of his organization being \"used as a punching bag all of the time.\" Planned Parenthood has been at pains to point out, for instance, that abortions only account for 3 percent of the services it provides. Said Teague: \"They (anti-abortion activists) like to throw out false accusations on a whole lot of levels . . . They just like to make us out as the bad guys, the evil forces, all of the time.\" Our ruling Hill at first boldly claimed that doctors who perform abortions were flying in and then out of the state, but when challenged by a Democratic colleague acknowledged he had no specific knowledge that it had occurred. The director of Tennessee's leading anti-abortion would not provide any evidence that the practice has occurred either. Planned Parenthood claims this does not happen. With no evidence to support this claim, we rule it False."

The Nazis loudly opposed democracy, the first and foremost thing.\" Also, he said, \"they were opposed to emancipating the workers, giving them the rights to vote and to organize\" in unions.",
      "Similarly, Barbara Miller Lane, a Bryn Mawr College professor and co-editor of a compilation of Nazi ideology before 1933, said by email: \"The Nazis were NOT democratic socialists,' whatever that means. The Nazis were never democrats and never real socialists either.\" While there was a longstanding and distinguished Social Democratic Party in Germany from the 1870 to the 1920s, Lane wrote, the Nazis fought against it, and after 1933 imprisoned its leaders.",
      "Lane added: \"The Nazis opposed all traditional socialism, wanting to substitute something they called German socialism' or Aryan socialism.' This meant citizenship and privileges only for Aryans' (meaning non-Jews), concentration camps for others.\"",

It quoted Brian Kennedy, a co-owner, saying the company--employing about 100 people, many of them Latino--had been making hats for Trump's golf courses for about a decade, which is how Kennedy got connected with the campaign, the story said.",
      "The story called the made-in-China claim about Trump's hats a \"short-lived rumor.\"",
      "We're unsure about that. A web search combining Trump and \"hats made in China\" yielded more than 3,000 results. Meantime, a July 2016 Associated Press news story said that its commissioned tests of fabric in five Trump campaign hats showed that one sampled hat was stitched from cloth of unknown, possibly foreign origin. Federal law requires that items labeled \"Made in USA\" be made from materials \"all or virtually all\" from the United States, the story said.",
      "Kennedy told the AP: \"I'm not using imported materials. We're playing by the rules.\"",
      "Hicks, the Trump spokeswoman, previously confirmed other facts about the authentic Trump campaign hat, which continues to be sold for $25 to $30 in patriotic and camouflage shades at Trump's campaign store. Separately, Kennedy said the company had been making that style of hat since the 1970s.",
      "PunditFact found the hats were distributed by Ace Specialties LLC, a Lafayette, La., company. Ace Specialties president and owner Christl Mahfouz said: \"Definitely everything on our side is made in the USA.\"",
      "For this fact check, we called Cali-Fame to check on changes in where the hats are made, if any. Tim Kennedy, a co-owner, declined to comment except to direct us to Hicks.",
      "There's heft to claims that some Trump gear has been made outside the U.S.",
      "In 2011, then-Late Show host David Letterman brought out various buttoned shirts and ties included in the Trump brand clothing line for Macy's (which later dumped Trump after his fiery statements about Mexicans in July 2015).",
      "Letterman pointed out that his ties and shirts were made in China. At the time, Trump was supporting Republican Mitt Romney for president and had been accusing China of taking American manufacturing jobs. Trump smirked as the crowd cheered before he defended himself, saying \"it's very hard to get product that's not made in China\" because of the country's currency manipulation.",
      "By email, Israel initially told us she'd misspoken. Asked if she intended her China mention to be factual, Israel said by phone: \"I did. I am surprised that the hats were not made in China because everything else around him seems to be outsourced.\" She said she'd also seen an ad featuring the Letterman interview of Trump about his namesake items made abroad.",

      "A San Antonio congressman, already on record in support of Donald Trump for president, told Texas delegates to the Republican National Convention that Trump's on target characterizing some immigrants as criminals.",
      "U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith said at the Texas delegation's July 17, 2016, breakfast in Cleveland that Trump \"knew what he was talking about. One-third of all federal prisoners today are illegal immigrants. They have committed some of the most worst crimes; they have committed the rapes and the murders and everything else.\"",
      "We wondered if indeed one-third of federal prisoners were in the country without legal authorization. Not so, we ultimately found. Smith was citing a slightly outdated figure of individuals sentenced to the federal pen in a given year, not the total federal prison population.",
      "Right off, we suspected Smith was off base. Our June 2016 fact check of a different claim took note that as of April 2016, nearly 80 percent of the federal system's approximately 195,000 inmates were U.S. citizens; 15 percent were citizens of Mexico, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.",
      "A bureau breakout up to date as of late July 2016 showed the citizenship percentages to be about the same; so, you'd expect inmates living in the country without legal authority to comprise an even smaller share of the prisons' population.",
      "Yet Smith spoke before that breakout was posted. When we asked his House spokeswoman, Jennifer Pett, the basis of his claim, she said by email that he was referring to \"illegal alien\" immigration statuses shown for nearly 37 percent of individuals sentenced to federal prison in the fiscal year running through September 2014, as shown in a chart from the U.S. Sentencing Commission.",
      "This turned out to be the latest-available breakdown we could find of incoming prisoners by immigration status. According to the chart, 58 percent (43,479) of the 74,911 individuals that year were U.S. citizens. Otherwise, the chart notes 27,505 \"illegal\" residents sent to prison plus 3,017 foreigners living here with legal permission, 206 people under extradition and 704 individuals with unknown statuses.",
      "Of the \"illegal\" residents, 20,333 74 percent of them were primarily sentenced for immigration violations, not violent crimes, according to the chart. Nine unauthorized immigrants were primarily convicted of murder, 50 of assault, 19 of sexual abuse, the chart shows.",
      "Next, we inquired into the share of federal inmates, as Smith put it, who are currently held after living in the country absent legal permission.",
      "On behalf of the sentencing commission, which gathers information on federal crime and sentencing issues, spokeswoman Christine Leonard confirmed the validity of Smith's fiscal 2014 chart. Leonard said the agency hasn't posted a similar analysis for the fiscal year running through September 2015. But in fiscal 2015, she pointed out, 29,166 noncitizens--not necessarily living in the U.S. without legal permission--accounted for 42 percent of the 70,255 people sentenced to federal prison.",
      "According to the fiscal 2015 chart, 19,240 of the sentenced noncitizens, 66 percent of them, were primarily sentenced for immigration violations. Among 9,926 noncitizens primarily convicted of a non-immigration violation, 62 were primarily convicted of assault, 24 of sexual assault, 15 of murder, the chart indicates.",
      "We also asked the Bureau of Prisons for the percentage of undocumented immigrants among the entire federal prison population the group that Smith singled out in his statement. No such data are available, spokesman Justin Long advised us by email. But the bureau does tally the proportion of inmates by citizenship status--and noncitizens have recently accounted for 22 percent of all inmates.",
      "We sought a longer view. Long replied with numbers indicating the share of noncitizens among federal inmates has gradually decreased. Noncitizens comprised nearly 30 percent of inmates in September 2000; 27.3 percent in September 2005; 25.4 percent as of September 2012 and 22.4 percent as of September 2015, similar to the 22 percent of late, Long said.",
      "Still, could it be there's been fluctuation with the share of immigrant-inmates spiking some months?",
      "Doesn't look like it. Since January 2016, Long replied, the greatest monthly share of noncitizens among inmates was 21.9 percent, the least 21.6 percent.",
      "Next, we asked outside experts why it'd be that noncitizens make up 22 percent of inmates of late despite the fact that \"illegal aliens\" accounted for nearly 40 percent of the people sentenced to federal prison in fiscal 2014.",
      "Their consensus: The standing population of inmates reflects a good number of prisoners serving longer sentences while most noncitizens sent to prison were convicted of immigration crimes, which mostly entail shorter sentences.",
      "Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that focuses on lessening immigration, summed up by email: \"With immigration offenders, there is high volume but shorter sentences, so faster turnover, which translates to a smaller percentage of the average daily population\" in prison.",
      "Meantime, Julie Samuels of the Urban Institute pointed out an institute chart showing that people convicted of immigration violations in fiscal 2014 accounted for a greater share of people sent to prison than they did of the total prison population:",
      "",
      "SOURCE: Report, \"Transforming Prisons, Restoring Lives Final Recommendations of the Charles Colson Task Force on Federal Corrections,\" the Urban Institute, January 2016",
      "Another authority, Nazgol Ghandnoosh of the Sentencing Project, which says it focuses on reforms in sentencing policy, pointed out that as of the end of December 2014, some 69,000 of the 1.6 million state plus federal prisoners were noncitizens, per a September 2015 report by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, though we noticed that report lacked counts for several states including California.",
      "After we circled back to Smith's office with the figures we'd found, Smith's deputy chief of staff, Chris Philp, said by email that Smith had meant to tell the delegates that \"one-third of federal sentences go to illegal immigrants, not that one-third of federal prisoners are illegal immigrants.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Smith told his fellow Texans: \"One third of all federal prisoners today are illegal immigrants.\"",
      "Not so. Rather, this figure ties to the 37 percent share of individuals sentenced to prison in fiscal 2014 who weren't legally living in the country--and there doesn't appear to be a more recent breakdown.",
      "More to the point, the government doesn't sort all inmates by immigration status, which leaves us with its guidance that as of mid-2016, 22 percent of inmates weren't U.S. citizens. It seems logical to conclude that unauthorized residents comprised a smaller share of all the prisoners.",

      "Ted Cruz of Texas stirred an Austin crowd by declaring that Hillary Clinton favors abortion without limit.",
      "The Republican senator characterized the Democratic presidential nominee's position after an audience member at the September 2016 Texas Tribune Festival asked why the father of two young girls could support \"a candidate who is so openly misogynistic,\" referring to Cruz's endorsement the day before of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.",
      "Cruz stressed his concerns about entrusting Clinton with nominating Supreme Court justices who would, he said, threaten his daughters' constitutional rights.",
      "When he paused, the audience member voiced another question: \"Like the right to choose?\"",
      "Cruz replied that the \"right to life\" needs to be protected, adding: \"I can also tell you even on the question of the right to life that the views of Hillary Clinton on abortion are radical and extreme. Her views: She supports unlimited abortion on demand up until the moment of birth, including partial-birth abortion, with taxpayer funding.\"",
      "Unlimited to the moment of birth? Readers asked us to check this claim.",
      "For starters, it's worth noting that abortions in the weeks leading up to birth are rare; 91 percent in 2012 occurred before the 14th week of pregnancy, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based reproductive health nonprofit. That year, the institute says, 1.3 percent took place in the 21st week or later. Notably too, as of October 2016, Texas ranked among 15 states to have proscribed abortion after about 20 weeks post-fertilization, the institute says.",
      "",
      "",
      "It's also so that abortions earlier in pregnancy aren't always available on short notice. Twenty-eight states have statutory waiting periods for an abortion, PolitiFact Ohio noted in August 2016, and 14 states require physician counseling that necessitates two trips to a medical facility prior to an abortion.",
      "Clinton through the years",
      "And how does Clinton herself characterize her abortion position?",
      "We perused her own statements and one of her votes as a New York senator.",
      "A January 2016 \"fact sheet\" on her campaign website states that as president, Clinton will ensure the right to choose an abortion is protected, a reference to the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion.",
      "Also, the sheet says, Clinton will \"repeal the Hyde amendment to ensure low-income women have access to safe reproductive health care.\" That's potentially a call for more federally funded abortions in that the Hyde amendment, regularly embraced by Congress since 1976, bars government funding of abortion through Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or to save the health or life of the mother.",
      "According to a 2016 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, similar \"restrictions affect the appropriations for other federal entities, including the Department of Justice, where federal funds may not be used to perform abortions in the federal prison system, except in cases of rape or if the life of the mother would be endangered.\"",
      "Hyde acts as a rider on federal appropriations bills. As such, PolitiFact Ohio noted in August 2016, it doesn't have to be \"repealed\" to be deactivated. Bills on federal spending could just cease to include it. Some states have Hyde-like restrictions on their Medicaid dollars, and would have to change their guidelines to open an avenue to fund abortions if Hyde disappeared at the federal level.",
      "Clinton has long said that she'd support a late-term limit on abortion--provided it has exceptions.",
      "In 2003, as a senator for New York, Clinton was on the losing end of a 64-33 floor vote to advance the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 later signed into law by President George W. Bush. That change--barring physicians from knowingly performing intact dilation and extraction on a living fetus--had no exception to preserve the health or life of the woman.",
      "\"Clearly, the administration and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle see this as an opportunity to begin to eliminate Roe v. Wade,\" Clinton said at the time, according to an NPR news report, \"and the possibility of safe, legal and rare abortions in this country. And many young women don't seem to understand that this is not an option that they can take for granted.\"",
      "Earlier, in an Oct. 8, 2000, candidate debate, Clinton said: \"I have said many times that I can support a ban on late-term abortions, including partial-birth abortions, so long as the health and life of the mother is protected. I've met women who faced this heart-wrenching decision toward the end of a pregnancy. Of course it's a horrible procedure. No one would argue with that. But if your life is at stake, if your health is at stake, if the potential for having any more children is at stake, this must be a woman's choice.\"",
      "In March 2016, more recently, Bret Baier of Fox News asked Clinton during a Democratic presidential town hal whether she favors legal restrictions on abortion at any stage of pregnancy.",
      "That exchange:",
      "BAIER: \"Do you think a child should have any legal rights or protections before it's born? Or do you think there should not be any restrictions on any abortions at any stage in a pregnancy?\"",
      "CLINTON: \"Well, again, let me put this in context, because it's an important question. Right now the Supreme Court is considering a decision that would shut down a lot of the options for women in Texas, and there have been other legislatures that have taken similar steps to try to restrict a woman's right to obtain an abortion.",
      "\"Under Roe v. Wade, which is rooted in the Constitution, women have this right to make this highly personal decision with their family in accordance with their faith, with their doctor.",
      "\"It's not much of a right if it is totally limited and constrained.",
      "\"So I think we have to continue to stand up for a woman's right to make these decisions, and to defend Planned Parenthood, which does an enormous amount of good work across our country.\"",
      "BAIER: \"Just to be clear, there's no -- without any exceptions?\"",
      "CLINTON: \"No -- I have been on record in favor of a late pregnancy regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother.",
      "\"I object to the recent effort in Congress to pass a law saying after 20 weeks, you know, no such exceptions, because although these are rare, Bret, they sometimes arise in the most complex, difficult medical situation.\"",
      "BAIER: \"Fetal malformities and \"",
      "CLINTON: \"And threats to the woman's health.\"",
      "BAIER: \"Sure.\"",
      "CLINTON: \"And so I think it is -- under Roe v. Wade, it is appropriate to say, in these circumstances, so long as there's an exception for the life and health of the mother.\"",
      "Abortion at birth?",
      "When we inquired about the basis of Cruz's claim, a Senate office spokesman, Phil Novack, said by email that the ruling in Roe v. Wade and another issued the same day in Doe v. Bolton meant from the start that a woman could obtain an abortion \"on demand\" up to giving birth.",
      "This intepretation presents as extremely permissive the court's stipulation that states may restrict abortion after fetal \"viability\" except \"where necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\"",
      "Among analysts quoted by Novack, Michael Paulsen of the University of St. Thomas School of Law wrote in 2003 that it's \"clear to all today that Roe, in tandem with Doe v. Bolton, in fact created a regime of abortion-on-demand throughout all nine months of pregnancy for any reason agreed to by the mother and abortionist.\" We followed up with Paulsen, who said by email that the court's allowance of a late-term abortion to protect a woman's health could extend to \"any physical, medical, emotional, psychological, or family reason a woman might evoke. The breadth of the health' exception/loophole is stunning,\" Paulsen told us.",
      "Other legal scholars challenge this read.",
      "To our inquiries, Lawrence Sager, a constitutional expert at the University of Texas School of Law, and Priscilla Smith, a Yale law professor who's advocated for reproductive rights, each said the mandate that a physician determine if an abortion is needed to protect a woman's health hasn't played out lightly.",
      "By email, Smith said a physician could lose her or his license to practice or face criminal charges if the judgment that an abortion was needed to protect the woman's health was later found inappropriate.",
      "\"Physicians do not take these significant potential penalties lightly,\" Smith wrote, which she said partly explains the rarity of late-term abortions. \"The other reason is that women don't just wake up one day after carrying a pregnancy for six months or more and decide to end it unless there is something really wrong with them,\" Smith said.",
      "Other fact checks",
      "Earlier this year, PolitiFact National and the Fact Checker at The Washington Post each noted that Clinton had repeatedly declared she'd support a law limiting late-term abortion if it includes exceptions to protect the health of the woman.",
      "PolitiFact National rated False a claim that Clinton \"believes that all abortions should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child.\" That ruling noted Clinton had said she supports restrictions on late-term abortions except in cases of rape, incest and when the mother's life and health are in danger--which wasn't the same thing as unequivocally supporting abortions \"even on the due date.\"",
      "The Fact Checker gave four Pinocchios to a claim that Clinton \"supports that a child can be aborted any time up until the moment it is born.\" Conceding that some abortion opponents deem the \"health\" exception for abortion a loophole that allows a woman to get a late-term abortion, the story said \"the fact remains that Clinton is on record as accepting that there can be restrictions to abortion well before the imminent birth of the baby.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Cruz said Clinton \"supports unlimited abortion on demand up until the moment of birth, including partial-birth abortion, with taxpayer funding.\"",
      "Clinton clearly supports a woman's right to choose an abortion and she's called for ending congressional restrictions on Medicaid funding of abortions.",
      "However, she's said since 2000 that she'd support a legislated late-term limit on abortion if it included an exception to protect the health of the woman--which the law against partial-birth abortions does not. She hasn't pitched for unlimited abortion on demand.",

      "Stein drew our curiosity when she went on: \"They don't have a solution to the expanding wars except more wars.

      "Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas says the federal government is about to give away control of the internet.",
      "Really?",
      "A shift has been in motion, we found, yet not a handoff of all things web.",
      "As of October 2016, that is, contractual federal oversight of the California nonprofit that's managed website domains since 1998--the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers--is set to end in what proponents including ICANN and administration officials describe as a long-planned shift to the greater world community.",
      "The transition plans accelerated, according to a March 2014 New York Times news story, in the wake of revelations in documents made public by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that the U.S. had been intercepting internet traffic as part of global spying efforts.",
      "This summer, Cruz and a fellow Republican, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin, introduced the Protecting Internet Freedom Act to bar any handoff of the internet-related duties unless Congress gives approval. Talking up the proposal, Cruz said in Sept. 8, 2016, floor remarks: \"In 22 short days, if Congress fails to act, the Obama administration intends to give away control of the internet to an international body akin to the United Nations.\"",
      "Cruz went on to say the administration is \"pushing through a radical proposal to take control of internet domain names and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries.\" Cruz warned too that this will empower countries such as Russia, China and Iran to censor speech on the web.",
      "Cruz's backup",
      "We sought the basis of Cruz's statement about the administration giving away control of the internet. By email, Cruz spokesman Phil Novack noted ICANN is slated to no longer be under contract with the federal government. His email said that under the slated-to-go arrangement, \"only the United States can authorize any changes to the authoritative root zone file, which is used to operate the internet and is essentially the master address book. By giving up those contracts, the United States is, in a very real sense, giving up control of the internet.\"",
      "By \"root zone file,\" Novack was referring to the nonprofit's coordination of the domain name system, meaning a text file of the top-level domains that form part of web addresses. Contrary to Novack's characterization, though, the root zone file is not the \"master address book\" of the Internet, Milton Mueller, a professor in the Georgia Institute of Technology School of Public Policy and author of a book on ICANN's creation, cautioned when we asked. Rather, Mueller said by email, the root zone file \"is just a list of top level domain names (like .COM, .ORG or .EDU).\" Mueller presents a longer description in this September 2015 blog post.",
      "Mueller told us the domain name system solely ensures \"that the domain names we use for websites and emails are globally consistent if you type in an Iranian domain your browser knows where to find it. A lot of other aspects of Internet operations, such as routing, are completely separate from this.\" And generally, Mueller said, the internet consists of about 50,000 different private networks worldwide that use the Internet protocols to interconnect. \"All of them operate their part of the Internet,\" Mueller wrote. \"All of them could bypass ICANN if they needed to or wanted to. They all use a common domain name root because it makes the system globally compatible.\"",
      "Novack further excerpted a 1998 agreement reached by the U.S. Department of Commerce stating, in part, that written direction from a government official shall be requested before \"making or rejecting any modifications, additions or deletions to the root zone file.\" By the government giving up that authority, Novack suggested, free speech on the web is at risk.",
      "Advocates declare flaws in claim",
      "Experts supportive of the pending changes told us there's a lot wrong in Cruz's claim.",
      "First, we connected with ICANN officials who told us the plan is to sever the corporation from its Commerce Department contract as of October 2016, leaving the \"global multistakeholder community\"--meaning the private sector, in consultation with technical and intellectual property experts and government representatives--to guide and handle established duties, without a particular country holding oversight.",
      "Michael Chertoff, a former secretary of Homeland Security supportive of the shift, wrote in June 2016 that the federal \"stewardship has greatly diminished as the organization (ICANN) has matured from a small operation on a shoestring budget to a large, professional corporation with more than 350 employees in seven offices around the globe. Global stakeholders, including U.S. businesses, end users, technical experts, public interest organizations and academics, oversee ICANN,\" Chertoff wrote.",
      "We inquired into the countries that, with the U.S., advise the corporation's 20-member board, which was chaired as of September 2016 by Steve Crocker, the CEO and co-founder of Shinkuro, Inc., a start-up; he's also one of the originators of the internet.",
      "Samantha Eisner, an ICANN lawyer, confirmed that the 171 countries advising the board include Russia, China and Iran as well as the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries. ICANN spokesman James Cole emailed us the full list of participating countries.",
      "When we checked, the chair of ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee was from Switzerland, its vice chairs from Argentina, Spain, Namibia, Thailand and Turkey. GAC membership, per the web page, stretched to include national governments \"and distinct economies recognized in international fora; and, usually in an observer capacity, multinational governmental and treaty organisations and public authorities (including all the U.N. agencies with a direct interest in global Internet governance such as the ITU, UNESCO and WIPO).\"",
      "And according to an advisory committee web page, the panel's advice must be taken into account by ICANN's board, which includes a single non-voting Governmental Advisory Committee liaison, \"and where the board proposes actions inconsistent with GAC advice it must give reasons for doing so and attempt to reach a mutually acceptable solution.\"",
      "So, we asked, might the advisory panel add up to a kind of United Nations?",
      "David Conrad, ICANN's chief technology officer, told us the advisory panel isn't a mini-UN in part because it's not a ruling body and any recommendation it makes must be unanimous--meaning any country can stop movement--though the committee can offer information or make suggestions to the board without a consensus.",
      "More broadly, Conrad and other ICANN officials stressed, it doesn't make sense to suggest a country controls the internet which, Conrad said, \"is comprised of a set of privately operated networks which agree to exchange traffic using a common set of protocols. There is no central point of control of the internet at all. So, the idea that the U.S. is somehow giving up control through a contract that its entire purpose is to allow the administration of a set of identifiers is just sort of ludicrous.\"",
      "Mueller, asked if Cruz's claim holds up, said by phone: \"There's no legitimate way for him to get to that conclusion. What he's doing is fear-mongering and trying to create a bogeyman, which is the United Nations.\" Mueller said the whole point of the approaching shift is to keep domain names' governance away from direct government oversight.",
      "Daniel J. Weitzner, an MIT official who told us he worked on the ICANN transition as an Obama administration adviser in the White House and Commerce Department, also responded to our inquiry by phone, saying the push for years has to been to ensure that no one country land the power to oversee the internet. Weitzner called Cruz's claim \"completely off base. There is no turnover to some nefarious organization.\"",
      "Separately, Michael Froomkin, a University of Miami law professor expert on ICANN, said by phone the U.S. government can't give away what it doesn't own--the internet--and Cruz's invocation of the U.N. seemed \"rather grandiose\" in that the duties at issue will continue to be overseen by the nonprofit whose board is advised only occasionally, Froomkin said, by the GAC. That said, he noted, the U.S. government will no longer independently contract with ICANN and so it will have less influence that way.",
      "Cruz's recommended authorities",
      "Novack, apprised that the experts we reached found Cruz's claim short of factual, urged us to consult others including Phil Kerpen, who heads the conservative American Commitment advocacy group and chairs the Internet Freedom Coalition, which opposes any UN attempts to manage the internet. By email, Kerpen said that in context, Cruz's claim is accurate; he said Cruz's reference to control of the internet refers to the about-to-go federal oversight and the UN mention reflects on the GAC which, Kerpen said, can only be overruled by a supermajority of the ICANN board.",
      "That's correct: ICANN's Cole told us that under revised bylaws, it'll take 10 (rather than the current nine) of 16 voting board members to spurn GAC advice while, Cole noted, it'll take even more votes to reject advice from the corporation's private sector policymaking body, the Generic Names Supporting Organization.",
      "Novack also pointed us to Brett Schaefer, a senior research fellow with the Heritage Foundation. By email, Schaefer suggested that while the intended transition wouldn't lead to \"government control' of ICANN as would be the case in a UN body, governments will have more authority in ICANN than they do currently.\" Schaefer and others said in a Sept. 8, 2016, white paper that governments will also be voting members of the new Empowered Community, which is vested with the power to dismiss the board or individual directors or reject or approve individual bylaw changes. \"Governments have not had a say in these matters before,\" the paper says.",
      "By email, ICANN spokeswoman Emily Crane Pimentel confirmed the fresh role for government representatives. Then again, she pointed out, other interest groups also will play new roles per a February 2016 document adopted by the \"multistakeholder community\" and, she said, governments won't end up with more power than other stakeholders.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Cruz said: \"If Congress fails to act, the Obama administration intends to give away control of the internet to an international body akin to the United Nations.\"",
      "As of October 2016, the U.S. government is set to no longer have a contract to oversee certain internet-related duties having to do with all of us finding websites. The tasks will continue to be handled through a California nonprofit that's been in place since 1998.",
      "Upshot: There's no pending government handoff of control of the internet that we can see. Also, the member-countries of an advisory panel to the nonprofit's board can only make a recommendation if every nation agrees; that's not U.N.-like.",

We made appropriate changes. Our rating of the claim didn't change.",

      "When we asked, Lauren Willis of the comptroller's office emailed us its chart indicating that in 2015, Texas had a gross domestic product of $1.59 trillion -- placing it 10th among countries behind the U.S. ($17.95 trillion) and eight countries including Brazil ($1.77 trillion).

Then again, more populous California had a GDP of $2.46 trillion, which would have placed the Golden State No. 6 in the world if it were a nation, nudging Texas to No. 11.

      "Former Republican powerbroker Tom DeLay recently raised alarm about Houston \"illegal immigrants\" taking advantage of tax-funded benefits.",
      "DeLay, seated in what looked like a comfortable spot, took split-screen questions from MSNBC's Kate Snow--both of them not quite getting facts straight.",
      "DeLay initially agreed in the Sept. 1, 2016, interview that \"deportations are up\" under President Barack Obama. Deportations hit a record high under Obama in 2013. However, the counts have since come down.",
      "The former U.S. House majority leader once known as the Hammer went on to say the flow of illegal immigrants also has gone way up--a claim that as of that month wasn't reflective of border-area apprehensions by the Border Patrol.",
      "\"I mean, right here in Houston, Texas,\" DeLay said, \"you can go three blocks from here and you have apartment complexes after apartment complexes packed full with illegal immigrants.\" He shortly added: \"Most of these illegals are drawing welfare benefits, they're sending their kids to school, they're using the public services. Many of them are paying taxes, I grant you that. But the impact,\" he said, \"is monumental.\"",
      "DeLay's comments fell in stride with a hot topic of the 2016 presidential race--the impact of unauthorized immigrants. Monumental or not, we wondered if he was right about government-funded benefits drawn by such residents.",
      "Some relevant recent fact checks:",
      "--In August 2016, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's claim there could be up to 30 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. came out Pants on Fire; the U.S. government and independent think tanks put the figure between 11 and 12 million.",
      "--The same day, Trump said unauthorized immigration costs more than $113 billion annually from federal, state and local coffers. That's Mostly False, PolitiFact found, in that Trump cited the highest of all estimates from a range that varied widely, and excluded data on unauthorized immigrant tax payments.",
      "--The month before, we found Half True a claim by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton that unauthorized immigrants annually pay $12 billion into Social Security. That amount was paid jointly by unauthorized immigrants and their employers.",
      "DeLay offers no backup",
      "DeLay, who resigned as majority leader in 2005 after his indictment on Texas campaign finance charges (his subsequent conviction was ultimately overturned), gave us a lot to consider, starting with what he had in mind in mentioning nearby apartment complexes rife with \"illegal immigrants.\"",
      "For a moment, we contemplated a field trip to see for ourselves, an option that fizzled after DeLay didn't provide backup information; when we reached him by phone, the line went dead. Dani DeLay Garcia, his daughter who sometimes serves as his spokeswoman, told us by email that he wouldn't be elaborating.",
      "Public schools and paying taxes",
      "For our part, we recognized that DeLay was correct about public schools serving children regardless of immigration status. In 2013, we found True a claim that the U.S Supreme Court had decided in 1982 that non-citizen children must get free public schooling through the 12th grade.",
      "Unauthorized immigrants also pay taxes, as DeLay said.",
      "Tanya Broder, a staff attorney for the National Immigration Law Center, said by phone that \"undocumented immigrants have the same tax obligations as any other resident.\" Broder emailed a 2015 report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan think tank, which drew on its analysis of state tax laws to estimate that unauthorized immigrants in Texas in 2012 paid about $1.5 billion in state and local sales and property taxes. Earlier, a 2006 report from the Texas state comptroller, applying Pew Research Center population research and comptroller tax models, estimated that unauthorized immigrants in Texas in 2005 paid $1.58 billion in state and local taxes.",
      "We focused next on whether unauthorized immigrants draw welfare and tap other public services.",
      "Welfare benefits",
      "The federal government hasn't distributed welfare checks to eligible people in poverty for around 20 years; that approach was replaced in the late 1990s by targeted aid programs jointly administered by the federal and state governments that provide assistance with cash, food, housing and health care. That act, the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, also barred unauthorized immigrants from drawing benefits.",
      "Title IV of the act, subheaded \"restricting welfare and public benefits for aliens,\" states that \"aliens who are not qualified aliens\" are ineligible for \"federal public benefits\" and for \"state and local public benefits.\" The act defines qualified aliens as people with certain legal documented immigration status, meaning unauthorized immigrants are not eligible.",
      "We confirmed from eligibility rules posted on government websites that unauthorized immigrants aren't eligible for major aid programs including Medicaid, the joint federal-state health coverage for people in poverty; Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which provides cash assistance to the impoverished elderly or disabled; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which used to be food stamps; housing assistance from the Department of Housing and Urban Development; and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), which provides grants for state-administered family assistance programs like child care, cash assistance or counseling.",
      "Separately, Broder and Randy Capps of the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that believes in the benefits of well-managed immigration, each told us federal welfare benefits aren't available to unauthorized immigrants.",
      "By phone, Jack Martin, author of reports on unauthorized immigrants in Texas for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates tighter immigration controls, put it this way: \"Illegal aliens are not eligible directly for welfare assistance\" though, he said, parents living in the country without permission can sign up qualified children for aid.",
      "All U.S.-born children are automatically U.S. citizens, even if born to unauthorized immigrants--and Martin was correct, we found, in that Medicaid eligibility rules specify that unauthorized immigrants \"may apply for coverage on behalf of documented individuals.\" Eligibility rules for SNAP say that a person who is ineligible because of immigration status \"may choose to apply only for his or her U.S. citizen children in the household.\"",
      "On the other hand, Broder said, certain federal benefits are available to children regardless of residency status: the Child and Adult Care Food Program, which provides food aid to care centers for low income children, elderly or disabled adults; the National School Lunch and Breakfast Program, which subsidizes in-school meals for children from low income families; and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, which provides nutritional supplements and health education for pregnant women, breastfeeding women and their infants up to five years old who are deemed \"at nutrition risk\" by a doctor.",
      "Capps agreed those programs are open to unauthorized immigrants but said they're \"programs that I wouldn't consider welfare.\" Case said the basic nutrition programs qualified as public health spending. Regarding the school lunch program he said: \"I wouldn't consider it welfare the same way I wouldn't consider public schools welfare.\"",
      "Public services",

      "Capps said there were state-administered public health services available to residents regardless of immigration status while Alex Nowrasteh, an analyst for the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, nudged us afresh to the 2006 report from the Texas state comptroller.",
      "That report, \"Undocumented Immigrants in Texas: a financial analysis of the impact to the state budget and economy,\" listed nine publicly-funded programs for which unauthorized immigrants in Texas were eligible--public schools plus eight health care programs: emergency medical care for indigent residents; Children with Special Health Care Needs; substance abuse services; mental health services; immunizations; Women's and Children's Health Services; public health programs; and emergency medical services such as ambulances.",
      "We wondered if the listed programs continue to be open to anyone regardless of immigration status. Seems so; agency-posted eligibility requirements do not say beneficiaries must be legal U.S. residents.",
      "SOURCE: Report, \"Undocumented immigrants in Texas: a financial analysis of the impact to the state budget and economy,\" Texas state comptroller Carole Strayhorn, December 2006",
      "In 2005, the report estimated, Texas spent about $58 million caring for unauthorized immigrants through the eight programs--compared to $57.8 billion in total state spending that year.",
      "Health Care",
      "As the largest health-related service used by unauthorized immigrants, the comptroller identified indigent care at public hospitals.",
      "The Texas Indigent Health Care and Treatment Act of 1989 requires Texas counties to fund stabilizing health services for indigent people without insurance. According to the act, county hospitals, public hospitals and hospital districts must admit anyone who earns 21 percent or less of the federal poverty level. That includes unauthorized immigrants, who the comptroller estimated drew $1.3 billion in such services in 2004.",
      "The services required under the 1989 act include: \"primary and preventative services,\" inpatient and outpatient hospital services, rural health clinics, laboratory and X-ray services, family planning, physician services, payment for up to three prescription drugs and \"skilled nursing facility services.\"",
      "We found specifics in a 2010 report from the Texas Health and Human Services Commission titled \"Report on services and benefits provided to undocumented immigrants.\" The report listed uncompensated costs incurred at each Texas public hospital in 2008, plus the estimated share of that cost \"attributable\" to unauthorized immigrants. The report estimated that between two and 22 percent of uncompensated costs are attributable to unauthorized immigrants at each of 99 public hospitals statewide, totaling about $717 million in 2008.",

      "An Austin legislator's imperfect citation of a study led us to gauge whether domestic violence can reasonably be considered a predictor of mass shootings.",
      "Answer: No.",
      "In a Nov. 9, 2017, email blast to constituents, Democratic state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez noted that the shooter at the church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, leaving 26 people dead, had been convicted years before of beating his then-wife and young stepson. According to news accounts, Devin P. Kelley subsequently served a year in a Navy brig.",
      "Rodriguez's email blast said the Texas shootings led him to suggest steps \"we can take,\" among them: \"Strengthening existing laws and ensuring they're implemented correctly to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.\" Parenthetically, Rodriguez said next that \"perpetrators of domestic violence accounted for 54% of mass shootings between 2009 and 2016, according to the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety.\"",
      "Domestic violence and mass shootings",
      "Rodriguez's linkage made us wonder, in part because Everytown's research drew wide mention after the Texas shootings.",
      "A Nov. 6, 2017, New York Times news story quoted Billy Rosen, the group's deputy legal director, saying: \"We have seen over and over this pattern where in these notorious mass shootings, it is a very common thread where the person had a particular history of domestic violence. A history of this particular kind of conduct may really demonstrate that someone has dangerous propensities and should not be allowed to have guns.\"",
      "Time magazine similarly quoted the group's Sarah Tofte saying: \"You could think of domestic violence as a canary in the coal mine for future violence. We may not know everything we need to know about why and when it reverberates outside the home, but we know that it does, and we've seen it over and over again.\"",
      "However, the relevant April 2017 report from the Everytown group doesn't offer data linking past domestic violence to the likelihood of anyone becoming a mass shooter. Rather, the report says that \"in 54 percent of mass shootings, the shooters killed intimate partners or other family members.\"",
      "We asked Rodriguez about this contrast. In reply, he conceded in a letter that his email blast lacked clarity.",
      "\"As I read your question,\" Rodriguez wrote, \"I can understand how my language could inadvertently imply that 54% of mass shooters also had a history of domestic violence, as opposed to the analysis' findings that 54% of the incidents were directly related to domestic violence.",
      "\"I agree that my language was unclear,\" Rodriguez wrote, \"as perpetrators of domestic violence' could be read as shooters who had committed domestic violence in the past or, as I meant it, as shooters who perpetrated domestic violence when they shot a current or former intimate or family member.' While grammatically vague, I had no intention of misrepresenting the group's findings.\"",
      "The legislator's claim and clarification made us wonder what data actually show about mass shooters having domestic violence backgrounds.",
      "April 2017 report",
      "The Everytown report says the group drew on news stories, FBI figures and police and court records (in 76 instances) to identify 156 mass shootings in the study period--including 85 (54.5 percent) in which the perpetrator \"shot a current or former intimate partner or family member.\" Mass shootings can be defined in different ways. The Everytown group tallied shootings involving four or more victims, not counting the shooter.",
      "In the report's appendix, which summarizes each identified shooting, we spotted 13, or 8 percent, that occurred after a domestic dispute or in which the shooter had previously been charged with or linked to domestic violence.",
      "Around the same time, though, criminologist James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University professor, found more domestic violence links to the shootings catalogued by the group. Fox said in a USA Today commentary published after Rodriguez sent out his email blast that of Everytown's 85 listed shootings in which a person shot a family member, 41 percent were preceded by other acts of domestic violence. More broadly, Fox wrote, 25 percent of all the men listed as committing mass shootings showed \"any indication of prior domestic violence.\"",
      "We asked Fox to share the specifics behind his percentages. By email, he said we'd need to get the spreadsheet directly from the Everytown group. Its spokeswoman, Phoebe Kilgour, had earlier emailed us a sheet lacking entries specifying prior domestic violence charges or convictions. Kilgour, asked for more detail, said the limited information was \"what we're comfortable sharing at this point.\"",
      "Separately, Lisa Growette Bostaph, a Boise State University criminologist, responded to our inquiry by saying that her review of Everytown's information delivered domestic-violence counts matching what Fox reported; she also provided her annotated review of what Everytown listed.",
      "By email, Bostaph also cautioned against dwelling on whether mass shooters have documented backgrounds of domestic violence, writing:",
      "Parsing \"out whether or not a protection order was granted or a criminal charge resulted in a conviction is ignoring everything that we know about domestic violence: that victims are often manipulated and controlled by fear to rescind requests for protection and criminal charges; that victims are often silent about the domestic violence out of fear of involving others who may later be threatened or hurt; fear of angering the perpetrator and risking further violence for \"bringing others into our business\"; fear that the perpetrator may lose their job and the victim cannot provide for their children on their own; fear that, by leaving their abuser, they could be risking their abuser having custody or unsupervised visitation with their children who are often witnesses to the violence and/or abused themselves. This means that, if the domestic violence victim is also a victim in the mass shooting, we may never know if there was a history of domestic violence. But, does that really matter, when the end result of that relationship was the ultimate act of domestic and/or family violence?\"",
      "A mass killing' compilation",
      "Fox otherwise alerted us to an ongoing USA Today compilation of U.S. mass killings, drawing from FBI figures plus police and news reports. When we examined it in November 2017, it showed 271 mass shootings of four or more victims from 2006 through Nov. 5, 2017. We sorted those figures to find that 129 of the shootings, or 48 percent, involved family killings including 13 of 23 Texas mass shootings. The day that we looked, the latest listed Texas mass shooting involving family had occurred in Houston in April 2017; a single mother shot and killed four people including her mother and sister.",
      "That compilation doesn't filter out shootings involving a shooter with a domestic violence history.",
      "But Fox connected us with Emma Fridel, a Northeastern doctoral student who's conducted more detailed research rooted in USA Today's compilation. To our inquiry, Fridel summarized her findings in an email stating that from 2006 through 2016, the country experienced 205 solved mass murders exclusively involving firearms. Of those, Fridel said, she found that 41, or 20 percent, involved one or more perpetrators with a history of domestic violence. (See Fridel's full analysis, published in early November 2017, here.)",
      "Fox, summing up, said: \"You could certainly say about half the cases of mass shootings are extreme incidents of domestic violence,\" which in itself persists as \"a serious problem,\" Fox said. \"But it's not generally a precursor to mass murder,\" he said.",
      "Report: Domestic disputes precipitated a fifth of mass public shootings'",
      "Separately, Time's story after the Texas shootings led us to experts including Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Davis, who by email pointed us to a 2015 report on U.S. mass murders by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.",
      "According to the CRS report, in the 15 years from 1999 through 2013, the United States saw about 8.5 familicide mass shootings per year on average. From another vantage point, the report says, a domestic dispute of some type was allegedly a precipitating factor in roughly a fifth (21.2%) of \"mass public shootings,\" or at least 14 of 66 such incidents. Four other mass public shooting incidents could also be characterized as familicides, the report says, in that a spouse or former intimate partner murdered four or more family members--in each case in a public space.",
      "Time's article also drew us to interview Susan B. Sorenson, who directs the Evelyn Jacobs Ortner Center on Family Violence at the University of Pennsylvania. By phone, Sorenson endorsed Everytown's statistic--that 54 percent of its catalogued mass shootings were acts of domestic violence. Sorenson also told us there's not research cementing a cause-and-effect link between someone committing domestic violence and later shooting and killing four or more people. \"That's all speculative,\" Sorenson said. \"We just don't have that information.\"",
      "From a public health perspective, Sorenson commented, the focus should be on reducing gun violence. She said there are angry men \"who abuse women all over the globe. What makes us different is the guns.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Rodriguez wrote that according to an Everytown study, \"perpetrators of domestic violence accounted for 54% of mass shootings between 2009 and 2016.\"",
      "Rodriguez's statement incorrectly suggests that domestic violence was a precursor to 54 percent of mass shootings. The research he cited did not confirm as much. Rather, it says 54 percent of such shootings involved a person shooting multiple family members.",
      "Other research suggests that about 20 percent of individuals who committed such shootings from 2006 through 2016 had a history of domestic violence.",

      "Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick opened his full-throated endorsement of Texas legislation targeting transgender access to bathrooms by quoting the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.",
      "Patrick, joined by the proposal's author, state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, told reporters at the Texas Capitol on Jan. 5, 2017: \"Martin Luther King said our lives begin to end the day we become silent on things that matter.",
      "\"This legislation, the Texas Privacy Act, that Sen. Kolkhorst is filing today, is unquestionably one of the things that matters,\" Patrick said. \"It's the right thing to do. I know it, Texans know it and Sen. Kolkhorst knows it.\"",
      "Debate over the measure--banning transgender people from using the Texas bathroom of their choice--will play out in the 2017 legislative session. We focused on the origin of Patrick's King quotation.",
      "Patrick offers no backup",
      "We didn't hear back from Patrick about when and where the slain civil rights leader made the singled-out statement, which went noted in the Associated Press's account of Patrick's remarks and quoted by the Dallas Morning News.",
      "For our part, a web search for the quotation and \"King\" suggested by a professor yielded 2,980 results including books of poetry and documentation that President Clinton similarly quoted King in an April 2000 speech and Sen. Joe Lieberman did so in the Senate in June 2003.",
      "So, Patrick was in bipartisan company in crediting the words to King.",
      "On the other hand, we were unable to confirm that King made that exact declaration. Also, it's worth noting, King probably didn't expound on bathrooms except toward widening access to public facilities.",
      "A photo caption",
      "We started our look into this topic by trying to gauge if King said the words aired by Patrick.",
      "Right off, a web search yielded an undated New York Daily News photo of King giving a speech. The photo caption said: \"King was engaged in a battle with Sheriff Jim Clark over voting rights and voter registration in Selma. On March 8, 1965, King spoke from the pulpit on courage: Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.'\"",
      "Stanford researchers can't confirm",
      "Separately, though, King experts either said he likely didn't make the quoted remark or if he did, it's hard to confirm so with ease. \"That would be a research project,\" said Clayborne Carson, the Martin Luther King, Jr., Centennial professor of history at Stanford University and director of a research institute in King's name. By phone, Carson told us that's because the institute's resources aren't yet easily searched for a particular quotation. Put another way, he said by email, it's \"easier to prove what King said on a particular occasion than to prove that he never said the quote in question on any occasion.\"",
      "An institute research assistant, Ellen Ingebritsen, later responded that her search of the project's internal database and documents culled from the institute's King papers didn't turn up King making the statement. Then again, she said, the institute has yet to catalogue the majority of King's work from 1965. Otherwise, she said, King letters and telegrams from that year don't contain the words attributed to King by Patrick.",
      "A similar confirmed King statement",
      "Story over? Not quite.",
      "Other experts helped us find that King made a similar yet less direct statement in the Brown Chapel in Selma, Ala., on Monday, March 8, 1965--the same date noted in the News's photo caption and also the day after protesters met police violence after attempting to cross a bridge on the way to Montgomery, the state capital.",
      "King, who would shortly lead a crossing of the bridge before turning around, said in part: \"A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.\"",
      "Here's King's remark in context as we found it on an East Tennessee State University web page:",
      "\"Deep down in our non-violent creed is the conviction there are some things so dear, some things so precious, some things so eternally true, that they're worth dying for. And if a man happens to be 36-years-old, as I happen to be, some great truth stands before the door of his life--some great opportunity to stand up for that which is right.",
      "\"A man might be afraid his home will get bombed, or he's afraid that he will lose his job, or he's afraid that he will get shot, or beat down by state troopers, and he may go on and live until he's 80. He's just as dead at 36 as he would be at 80. The cessation of breathing in his life is merely the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit. He died...",
      "\"A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.",
      "\"So we're going to stand up amid horses. We're going to stand up right here in Alabama, amid the billy-clubs. We're going to stand up right here in Alabama amid police dogs, if they have them. We're going to stand up amid tear gas!",
      "\"We're going to stand up amid anything they can muster up, letting the world know that we are determined to be free!\"",

Burgess also helped us track down a YouTube video in which we saw King making the remarks, which the video attributes to a Nostalgia Company recording, \"The Greatest Speeches of All Time, Volume II.\"",
      "Separately, Carson told us his research took note of a similar King statement made Nov. 5, 1967, at his home church in Atlanta. King, exhorting parishioners to fight for what's right, said a person's failure to do so would amount to dying before death. \"You died when you refused to stand up for right, you died when you refused to stand up for truth, you died when you refused to stand up for justice,\" Carson quoted King saying.",
      "We also heard back from a King biographer, David Garrow, who said by email that his sense is that King didn't make the statement aired by Patrick. That \"language does *NOT* in any way sound familiar to me as an exact quote,\" Garrow wrote. \"I believe it is INVALID.\" Garrow summed up: \"Your verdict on this ought to be something like 'Unproven, undocumented, & highly doubtful.'\"",
      "Texas professors: Quotation out of context",
      "Asked to assess Patrick's quotation, University of Texas historians Don Carleton and Paul Stekler each opined that Patrick presented King's sentiment out of historical context.",
      "Stekler, who helped produce, direct and write a documentary on the civil rights movement in 1967-68, said by email that King \"was in Selma to try and force federal action to ensure voting rights, a campaign that was successful with the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in the aftermath of the police riot on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. He was advocating the expansion of rights for African-Americans in the South where they had been and were largely disenfranchised.\"",
      "Patrick, Stekler wrote, employed King's purported words in support of restricting the rights of transgender people. \"One use of the quote uses it in support of the expansion of rights, the other in restricting rights,\" Stekler said.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Per Patrick, King said our lives begin to end the day we become silent on things that matter.",
      "Patrick didn't show nor did we confirm that King made this direct statement. Then again, Patrick didn't specify he was quote-unquote directly quoting King while King in 1965 made a longer proclamation that might later have been paraphrased in the 14 words that Patrick and others including President Clinton ultimately attributed to the civil rights icon.",

      "Saying individual Americans should own fewer guns, a co-host of the news-like Weekend Update segment on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" wrapped in a claim about Texas.",
      "Colin Jost, who also wondered aloud about the mass shooter in Las Vegas owning 47 guns, said in the Oct. 7, 2017 episode: \"No one should own 47 of anything.\" Cats, for instance, Jost went on, before adding: \"There is a real law in Texas that says it's illegal to own more than six dildos. And I get why no one needs that many! If you have more than six dildos, it's a clear sign you are training for something awful.\"",
      "Cue laughter. But does Texas have such a law?",
      "An NBC spokeswoman, Lauren Roseman, declined to comment when we sought the basis of Jost's statement. We similarly failed to draw comment--about Jost's accuracy--from the Texas attorney general's office, law professors and representatives of Texas law officers and district attorneys.",
      "A law found unconstitutional",
      "For our part, we suspected that Jost was referring to a state law restricting \"obscene devices\" that remains in place despite being found unconstitutional by a federal appeals court nearly a decade ago. We recently looked into the law, which dates to the 1970s, in finding Mostly False a claim that U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the former Texas solicitor general, once supported a ban on sex toys. Cruz's defense of the law, we concluded, came as part of his duties as the state's top appellate lawyer at the time.",
      "Section 43.23 of the Texas penal code does not specify dildos. It states: \"A person commits an offense if, knowing its content and character, he wholesale promotes or possesses with intent to wholesale promote any obscene material or obscene device.\" Another provision specifies: \"A person who possesses six or more obscene devices or identical or similar obscene articles is presumed to possess them with intent to promote the same,\" the implication being that the person would violate the restriction on promoting such devices.",
      "In ruling against the state in February 2008, judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals cited Lawrence and Garner v. Texas, the U.S. Supreme Court's 2003 opinion striking down bans on consensual sex between gay couples, in violation of the 14th Amendment. State lawyers did not appeal the dildo ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "\"Just as in Lawrence,\" the circuit court judges wrote, \"the state here wants to use its laws to enforce a public moral code by restricting private intimate conduct. The case is not about public sex. It is not about controlling commerce in sex. It is about controlling what people do in the privacy of their own homes because the state is morally opposed to a certain type of consensual private intimate conduct. This is an insufficient justification after Lawrence.\"",
      "Law remains in place",
      "Lawyers familiar with the appeals court ruling agreed, when we asked, that the sexual devices statute remains in Texas law but that's an empty reality, most said.",
      "James C. Todd, a since-retired Texas assistant attorney general who defended the law in federal district court, said by phone he wasn't surprised that legislators haven't acted to repeal the law. His speculation: \"They don't want to go back and in the next election have it said (that) my opponent voted against a law to prohibit indecency.\"",
      "Todd said that while the law remains on the books, it's unenforceable; since it's declared unconstitutional, no prosecutor would prosecute someone for violating it, he said.",
      "Gary Krupkin, a Dallas lawyer who represents vendors of sex toys, said by email that the circuit court's ruling had the same effect as the Texas Legislature repealing the law. Krupkin said he's unaware of any other state law that could be used to ban, restrict, or otherwise impede the purchase, ownership, commercial sale or use of multiple dildos.",
      "Former judge suggests legal limbo",
      "We should otherwise note a legal twist explored by PolitiFact Florida in 2015. In 2008, a Texas state appeals judge upheld a conviction stemming from the sale of a vibrator by a store in Corpus Christi. The majority opinion upholding the Texas law was issued months after the federal circuit court had found it unconstitutional.",
      "In 2015, legal experts commented on this contrast by saying that technically, federal rulings are not directly binding on state courts, but plaintiffs still would be assured of relief if they pursued their case in federal court.",
      "In the July 2008 state appeals court ruling, Linda Reyna Ya ez, a judge on the 13th District Court of Appeals covering Brownsville north to Wharton, wrote that though the court embraced the circuit court's ruling against the law's constitutionality, it wasn't required to follow it.",
      "Ya ez wrote: \"Fifth Circuit precedent is not binding on Texas courts.\" The judge also wrote that because the state's chief criminal appeals court earlier held that the same law didn't violate due-process rights, the state appeals court had no binding basis to hold otherwise.",
      "In 1985, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had held that the statute did not violate an individual's right to privacy, concluding that there was no constitutional right to \"stimulate another's genitals with an object designed or marketed as useful primarily for that purpose.\"",
      "At our request, Ya ez, an Edinburg attorney who's no longer a member of the appeals court, re-read the ruling in October 2017. Next, she told us by phone that she stands by the conclusion despite her personal backing of the circuit court's ruling.",
      "\"I remember,\" she said, \"not being able to do what I really wanted to do,\" which would have been to find the law at fault, she said. But because the U.S. Supreme Court hadn't taken up the law's constitutionality while the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had previously upheld it, she said, \"I had absolutely no choice.\"",
      "\"Theoretically a law enforcement officer could still arrest somebody\" for violating the law, Ya ez said. \"This is the way it works. Sometimes you have these inconsistencies and people are left in limbo.\"",
      "Todd later agreed by phone that it's a rule of judicial decision-making that Texas appeals courts follow the highest state court's ruling even on a matter of federal constitutionality. Then again, Todd said, \"I've always felt like they're not going to ignore what the 5th Circuit says.\"",
      "Krupkin said by email that we'd have to check every Texas county to cement whether anyone has been prosecuted under the law. \"However, there is a very small cadre of attorneys that specialize in dildo defense. As part of that group, I have not heard of any prosecutions,\" Krupkin said.",

      "A Texas Democrat told congressional colleagues that President Donald Trump's outlined plan to cut taxes would hugely--and mostly--benefit America's wealthiest.",
      "U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin, whose district runs south into San Antonio, said in his Sept. 30, 2017, House floor remarks: \"Eighty percent of the tax breaks in this proposal go to the top 1 percent--that is, people making more than $730,000 a year.\"",
      "Doggett made his claim three days after Republicans issued a framework outlining a proposed tax system with just three tax brackets, at tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, down from the current seven tax brackets.",
      "For personal income-tax filers, the framework calls for doubling the standard income-tax deduction while repealing most itemized deductions, including personal exemptions for dependents.",
      "The framework further says that the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee \"will work on additional measures to meaningfully reduce the tax burden on the middle-class.\" Put another way, the legislation itself had yet to debut.",
      "The framework also lists big intended changes in business taxation including a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent.",
      "Doggett points to news story",
      "Doggett, asked the basis of his claim, pointed to an Associated Press news story citing a preliminary review of the framework that was issued Sept. 29, 2017, by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. According to the AP report, the center found \"that about 80 percent of the tax benefit would go to the top 1 percent with income above $730,000 annually by 2027.\"",
      "We confirmed that's what the center's analysis, \"A Preliminary Analysis of the Unified Framework,\" concluded for the year 2027. However, the center pegs the top-1-percent income figure for 2027 at $912,100 in 2017 dollars; it separately lists $730,000 as what the top 1 percent would earn in 2018 when about half the benefits would flow to the top 1 percent, the analysis says.",
      "Generally, experts told us that no other reports on the plan's effects on taxpayers came public before Doggett spoke. A few days later, though, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy -- a research group that partners with Citizens for Tax Justice, which advocates for the tax interests of middle- and lower-class families -- predicted that in all but a few states, at least half the framework's tax cuts would flow to the wealthiest 1 percent of residents.",
      "The nonpartisan Tax Foundation plans to issue a detailed impact analysis once the tax legislation firms up, an official there told us by phone. \"As an organization, we decided that the unified framework was not yet detailed enough,\" Scott Greenberg said. He noted that among unsettled variables were the size of a revised standard deduction and an increased child tax credit.",
      "Center's preliminary analysis",
      "Let's get to details in the center's analysis.",
      "For starters, the center's estimates presume that the plan takes effect in 2018 and would decrease federal revenue by $2.4 trillion over 10 years.",
      "\"In 2018,\" the analysis says, \"all income groups would see their average taxes fall, but some taxpayers in each group would face increases. Those with the very highest incomes would receive the biggest tax cuts.\"",
      "According to the center's estimates, the top 1 percent of Americans would get 53 percent of the plan's benefits at the start--though reap 79.7 percent of the benefits in its 10th year, 2027. That is, in 2018, 53 cents of every dollar in tax savings would go to the nation's wealthiest 1 percent of residents and in 2027, nearly 80 cents of every dollar in savings would accrue to the top 1 percent, the center estimates.",
      "A pause: Chris Edwards, a tax expert for the libertarian Cato Institute, cautions against solely considering the share of tax reductions potentially enjoyed by the super-wealthy. His nudge: Folks should be aware that the same Americans consistently account for a great deal of tax revenue. In 2014, according to IRS data posted by the Tax Foundation, the top 1 percent paid a greater share of individual income taxes, 39.5 percent, than the bottom 90 percent combined, 29.1 percent. The same year, per the government, the share of personal income earned by the top 1 percent of taxpayers rose to 20.6 percent.",
      "The center's analysis of the Republican framework says: \"Between 2018 and 2027, the average tax cut as a share of after-tax income would fall for all income groups other than the top 1 percent.\" In 2027, it says, the overall average tax cut would be smaller than in 2018, increasing after-tax incomes 1.7 percent. That year, the center says, about \"80 percent of the total benefit would accrue to taxpayers in the top 1 percent, whose after-tax income would increase 8.7 percent,\" the analysis says.",
      "Under the plan, the center says, the number of taxpayers paying more in taxes would generally rise over time. \"This is because the plan would replace personal exemptions, which are indexed for inflation, with additional credits for children and non-child dependents that are not indexed for inflation,\" its analysis says. \"In addition, indexing tax brackets and other parameters to the slower-growing chained Consumer Price Index means that over time more income is subject to tax at higher rates,\" it says.",
      "A center researcher, Joe Rosenberg, advised by phone that the conclusion that the wealthiest Americans would reap more of the tax benefits in the tenth year traces to other Americans bearing more tax losses as a result of losing itemized deductions, especially deductions for paying state and local income taxes. Rosenberg also singled out the proposal to end the personal exemption, indexed for inflation, with a child tax credit not indexed for inflation.",
      "Rosenberg said the center did not analyze the \"distributional\" effects of the outlined plan for other years, meaning there are no projections of the degree of benefits absorbed by any subset of earners for years other than 2018 and 2027.",
      "After the center posted its analysis, a White House adviser, Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, questioned the validity of the projections given multiple assumptions made by the center. Rosenberg, asked about that critique, pointed out that the center's analysis says up front that many aspects of the framework \"were unspecified or left to be determined by the tax-writing committees in Congress.\"",
      "Doggett stands by statement",
      "We informed Doggett that he didn't say in his claim that he was speaking solely about 2027 and he also gave the wrong figure for what the top 1 percent are projected to earn that year.",
      "Doggett replied by email: \"In my remarks, I specifically noted that the tax breaks would go to those making more than' $730,000 a year. You correctly note that the number increases (more than), not decreases (less than) in future years, which further bolsters my point that the benefits go to the very wealthy few. Since if anything, I understated how inequitable this proposal is, I am pleased you are focusing on the inequity.\" Doggett also said that last he checked, the AP news story he shared with us (posted online by the Austin American-Statesman) hadn't been updated to the 2027 dollar amount.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Doggett said \"80 percent of the tax breaks in\" President Trump's frameworked tax-cut \"proposal go to the top 1 percent, that is, people making more than $730,000 a year.\"",
      "The analysis Doggett referenced indeed indicates benefits will accrue to the very wealthy over time. Yet in the first year of changes, the top 1 percent are projected to draw a little over half the tax savings. The threshold of 80 percent going to the top 1 percent is projected for the tenth year. Also, Doggett's stated figure for incomes is too low; it ties to the first year of implementation.",

      "We're unaware of Sen. Cruz, elected in 2012 and seeking re-election in 2018, calling for a ban on sex toys.",
      "So, what was the Post talking about?",
      "The Post's tweet linked to the newspaper's Sept. 12, 2017, news story, which said, without added detail: \"Cruz, a Republican from Texas, is known for his strong religious convictions and family values stance and once even supported a ban on sex toys.\"",
      "Cruz calls claim totally false'",
      "Cruz did not respond to our inquiry for this fact-check. But he objected on Sept. 13, 2017, when CNN's Dana Bash asked: \"Do you appreciate the irony that you once defended a Texas law banning sales of sex toys?\"",
      "\"No,\" Cruz said. \"That's a good example, Dana, where the media runs with things that are just totally false.\" He elaborated that at one time, his duties as solicitor general for the Texas attorney general's office included defending state laws. \"One of those laws was a law restricting the sale of sex toys. It's a stupid law,\" Cruz said, adding that he believes consenting adults should do what they please in the privacy of their bedrooms.",
      "To get our own fix on Cruz's actions, we turned to news accounts, a legal brief, an appeals court ruling and an extensive April 2016 Mother Jones story about Cruz's role in a decade-old case that didn't rise to the Supreme Court.",
      "Law upheld, then found unconstitutional",
      "At issue: The State of Texas defending section 43.23 of the state's penal code, which states: \"A person commits an offense if, knowing its content and character, he wholesale promotes or possesses with intent to wholesale promote any obscene material or obscene device.\"",
      "After a U.S. district judge dismissed a challenge to the law, businesses selling sex toys appealed to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel, by 2-1, agreed with the business-plaintiffs and found the law in violation of the 14th Amendment right to privacy. The state didn't appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "February 2008 news accounts from the Associated Press and Austin American-Statesman said the ruling overturned the state's ban on sex toys. Under the spurned law, the American-Statesman story said, it had been illegal to sell, advertise, give or lend obscene devices, defined as a device used primarily for sexual stimulation. \"Anyone in possession of six or more sexual devices is considered to be promoting them,\" the story said, adding that the law dated to the 1970s and had seldom been enforced.",
      "Cruz's role",
      "And what was Cruz's role?",
      "Cruz, who had been solicitor general since 2003, didn't present the state's oral argument before the appellate panel, according to two attorneys involved in the dispute, Louis Sirkin, who represented businesses challenging the law, and James C. Todd, a since-retired assistant attorney general who defended the law in district court. Todd and Sirkin each told us the oral argument was given by another state lawyer, Bill L. Davis.",
      "In ruling against the state, the appellate judges cited Lawrence and Garner v.

It is about controlling what people do in the privacy of their own homes because the state is morally opposed to a certain type of consensual private intimate conduct. This is an insufficient justification after Lawrence.\"",
      "Appeals brief",
      "Earlier, the state framed its arguments for upholding the law in a January 2007 brief listing the names of the then-attorney general, Greg Abbott, and five state attorneys working for the agency helmed by Abbott -- including Cruz, Todd and Davis, whose signature alone appears on the brief and, again alone, on the state's unsuccessful post-ruling motion for rehearing. Our request to interview Davis didn't draw a reply from Attorney General Ken Paxton's office.",
      "The state's brief notes that no state law bars the private use of sexual devices nor is there a limit on advertising such products to meet medical needs. It's the government's legitimate interest to guard against the commercial sale of sex and \"discouraging prurient interests in sexual gratification\" and \"protecting minors,\" the brief says. Further, the brief says, the First Amendment doesn't protect commercial speech related to unlawful activity.",
      "The brief also says, in bold: \"There is no substantive-due-process right to stimulate one's genitals for non-medical reasons unrelated to procreation or outside of an interpersonal relationship.\" This section of the brief goes on to say the Supreme Court hasn't identified such a right.",
      "Lawyers comment",
      "To our inquiries, Todd and Gary Krupkin, a Dallas First Amendment lawyer who represents businesses selling such products, each commented by phone that Cruz supported restricting sex toys but that defending state laws also was his duty.",
      "\"Obviously,\" Todd said, \"the solicitor general doesn't write every brief. There's no doubt in my mind that Cruz would have reviewed it in some way,\" he said. So, Todd said, Cruz \"defended it. A lawyer's name on the brief means something. He was on it near the top, right under Greg Abbott's. He was responsible for assigning the case. He would have been responsible for supervising the\" respective \"lawyer.\"",
      "It ultimately was Cruz's duty to defend the law, each lawyer said. And that's \"regardless of his beliefs,\" Todd said. \"Our job in the attorney general's office was to make whatever case there is to be made about the law.\"",
      "Krupkin said: \"Cruz in his official capacity as solicitor general supported a ban. It gets too close to the line when you say Ted Cruz\" personally \"did this. Ted Cruz did that in his official position. I myself see a difference between the two,\" he said.",
      "Our ruling",
      "The Post's tweet called Cruz \"the same senator who once supported a ban on sex toys.\"",
      "This statement incorrectly suggests that Cruz called for a ban on sex toys while serving in the Senate or otherwise personally held that belief. We find no evidence to support that contention.

      "In a tweet, President Donald Trump ruled out a deal to restore a program protecting certain young immigrants from deportation in part by warning that the Mexico-U.S. border could soon be besieged by a pile of people.",
      "Trump said April 1, 2018: \"Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release. Getting more dangerous. Caravans' coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!\"",
      "The tweet folded in familiar terms. \"Catch and release\" refers to the practice of releasing immigrants apprehended at or near the border, expecting them to appear later before a U.S. immigration judge. DACA stands for the Trump-rescinded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program created on President Barack Obama's watch to shield hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation.",
      "We focused this fact-check on Trump's fresh statement that \"caravans\" are coming our way, presumably from south of the Texas-Mexico border.",
      "To our inquiry, a White House spokesman, Steven Cheung, said by email that there have been such caravans in the past and estimates indicate there are 1,000 individuals participating in the caravan Trump had in mind.",
      "A Fox News discussion",
      "Cheung didn't provide more detail. But before the president tweeted, a Fox News program the same morning featured a discussion of a caravan headed toward the U.S. through Mexico.",
      "CNN reported April 1, 2018: \"Trump appears to be referring to a migrant caravan assembled by the group Pueblo Sin Fronteras (People without Borders), which was discussed on Fox News' Fox & Friends' shortly before he published his tweet. It's not known if the President watched the specific segment, but he indirectly referenced claims mentioned in an on-air interview with a Border Patrol union representative.\"",
      "Similarly, a news story in The Washington Post pointed to the described caravan as the likely basis of Trump's concern. The Post story took note that a leader of the National Border Patrol Council, which says it represents some 18,000 Border Patrol agents and support personnel, had been interviewed on the Fox News program. Afterward, the council asserted in a web post that Trump's tweet was referring to a large group of immigrants making their way to the U.S. border.",
      "In the Fox News segment, the council's president, Brandon Judd, was asked how the Border Patrol would react to the group eventually arriving at the border. Judd responded that a Mexican government entity was helping the group proceed and Pueblos Sin Fronteras, a U.S. group, also was helping. Judd said that once the people made it across the border, each one could request political asylum before getting released by authorities and then not showing up later for an immigration hearing.",
      "News stories confirm caravan entered Mexico",
      "Fox News's report was accompanied by a photo tweeted by Adolfo Flores, national security correspondent for BuzzFeed News, who reported from Mexico March 30, 2018, that hundreds of men, women and children had crossed into Mexico from Central America and were moving north--1,200 as of the group's first night in Mexico, the story said.",
      "BuzzFeed's story said:",
      "\"For five days now hundreds of Central Americans children, women, and men, most of them from Honduras have boldly crossed immigration checkpoints, military bases, and police in a desperate, sometimes chaotic march toward the United States. Despite their being in Mexico without authorization, no one has made any effort to stop them.",
      "\"Organized by a group of volunteers called Pueblos Sin Fronteras, or People Without Borders, the caravan is intended to help migrants safely reach the United States, bypassing not only authorities who would seek to deport them, but gangs and cartels who are known to assault vulnerable migrants.\"",
      "As of March 30, the story said, the caravan had made it to the southern Mexico state of Oaxaca but it wasn't immediately successful getting participants onto a freight train heading north. Oaxaca, the state's capital, is more than 900 miles from Laredo, Texas on the border.",
      "Buzzfeed's story also said: \"While there are organizers from Pueblos Sin Fronteras leading the way, much of the effort to get to the U.S. border is in the hands of the migrants themselves.\" Also, the story says that according to organizers, about two-thirds of people are planning on crossing into the U.S. \"undetected or asking for some type of protection like asylum.\"",
      "Caravan spokesman: Not everyone will cross U.S. border",
      "That's not what we heard from Irineo Mujica Arzate, a Pueblos Sin Fronteras press contact who told us he was speaking to us from the caravan itself.",
      "Arzate said in a phone interview April 2, 2018 that the group helped organize two caravans in 2017 but, he said, there's only the existing caravan planned for 2018.",
      "Arzate said that he doesn't expect every member of the caravan to cross the U.S. border. Most will try to stay in Mexico, Arzate said, with about 200 to 300 individuals ultimately crossing the U.S. border to seek asylum--a forecast that we found to be far short of published forecasts. \"We're trying to do it in a sensible way,\" Arzate said.",
      "Pueblos Sin Fronteras says on its website that for 15 years, \"members have been reaching out to the most vulnerable immigrants in the United States and to migrants and refugees on the move.\" Members, the group says, \"accompany migrants and refugees in their journey of hope.\"",
      "On its site, Pueblo Sin Fronteras calls the caravan the \"Via Crucis,\" or Stations of the Cross, march. Our search of the Nexis news database yielded an April 2015 news story from the Malaysian national news service, Bernama, of a march that year from Mexico's southern border to Mexico City. According to the story, the \"Via Crucis\" name draws a parallel between the suffering Jesus endured and the ordeal experienced by migrants.",
      "News stories indicate a planned 2018 stop in Central Mexico",
      "Our search of the Nexis database for other news stories about the caravan turned up another account of the 2018 arrivals into Mexico. Noticias Financieras said in a March 26, 2018, story that nearly 1,500 people fleeing poverty and violence in Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala had entered Mexico--with the majority hoping to reach the U.S. border to be considered as refugees.",
      "Also, a March 26, 2018, story posted on SplinterNews.com, which describes itself as news and opinions that get under your skin, specified that the 1,500 people who entered Mexico would seek asylum in the U.S. after a month-long journey. The story quoted Rodrigo Abeja, described as a Mexico-based organizer with Pueblo Sin Fronteras, expressing surprise at the turnout. Abeja said the group's caravans in 2017 drew about 450 migrants, the story said.",
      "Then again, several accounts mentioned plans for caravan members to seek legal advice at a gathering in Puebla, in central Mexico. According to a fact-check from the Associated Press, posted the day after Trump tweeted, the caravan was scheduled to end later in April in Puebla, which is some 650 miles from the U.S. border. \"After the formal caravans end,\" the AP story said, \"some migrants do try to reach the U.S. border, but often just to turn themselves in and request asylum.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "President Trump tweeted that caravans of immigrants are coming to the Mexico-U.S. border.",
      "We confirmed that a caravan of 1,200 to 1,500 people from Central America--not caravans--was in southern Mexico, about 900 miles from the Rio Grande, when Trump tweeted. Also, accounts vary on whether all participants are bound to enter the U.S. An organizer estimated that most of the people intend to remain in Mexico.",

      "Austin Mayor Steve Adler, who seeks a second term this November, reacted to a game-show moment with a swaggering claim.",
      "In an April 25, 2018, tweet, Adler responded to this clue from that night's episode of Jeopardy: \"Per Rick Perry, it's the blueberry in the tomato soup.\" Perry, the Republican former governor, often offers the \"blueberry\" characterization of the Democrat-dominant capital.",
      "On the program, a contestant correctly answered \"Austin\" for $600. Next, Adler said in his tweet, accompanied by a photo of the Jeopardy clue: \"What is the safest big city in Texas with an unemployment rate under 3% that has been named the best place to live in the entire United States two years running?\"",
      "Is all of that true about Austin?",
      "Not all: In 2017, we found Half True an Adler reference to Austin as the state's safest big city. Not for the first time, we noted then that the FBI advises against using crime data it collects to declare one city \"safer\" than another. That said, such statistics at the time suggested both that the five-county Austin region in 2015 had a lower violent-crime rate than other Texas regions and that El Paso had a lower violent-crime rate than Austin in the first half of 2016.",
      "Seeking mayor's factual backup",
      "The morning after Adler posted his comment, which was retweeted more than 200 times, we reached mayoral spokesman Jason Stanford. Stanford advised by phone that Adler didn't have fresh information to offer in support of his 2018 \"safest big city in Texas\" statement. He suggested we check federal statistics to confirm Austin's jobless rate and told us that U.S. News had consecutively named Austin the nation's best place to live.",
      "Checking Austin's unemployment",
      "Our search for Austin's jobless rate on the Texas Workforce Commission website showed that from January through March 2018, the latest month of available data, the city's jobless rate ran shy of 3 percent. We also fetched a longer view showing the city's jobless rate mostly staying below 3 percent from January 2017 on (all the rates not seasonally adjusted).",
      "Austin's unemployment rate was last above 3 percent, according to the TWC, when it was 3.1 percent in August 2017. The Austin rate's 15-month low, 2.5 percent, occurred in December 2017:",

      "On April 10, 2018, U.S. News announced that for the second straight year, the online publication found Austin the best place to live in the United States among the country's 125 largest metropolitan areas; Colorado Springs, Colo., placed second.",
      "The rankings were based on affordability, job prospects and quality of life, U.S. News said, and on surveying thousands of U.S. residents \"to find out what qualities they consider important in a home town. The methodology,\" U.S. News said, also factored in data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the FBI and the Bureau of Labor Statistics--plus U.S. News rankings of the country's high schools and hospitals.",

      "Another semi-warning in the story: \"Summers in Austin take some getting used to, with temperatures often scorching.\" Though, the story says, the \"metro area experiences mild weather throughout the rest of the year, though temperatures have been known to drop in the winter.\"",

      "A candidate seeking the Republican nomination to succeed Lamar Smith of San Antonio in the U.S. House says more black Americans die from abortion than any other cause.",
      "We wondered about that.",
      "State Rep. Jason Isaac of Dripping Springs, asked what policies he'd pursue to address safety and inequalities facing women and people of color, opened his reply: \"I will work to end abortion, which is the leading cause of death for black Americans and kills as many as 1,000 black children every day.\" That question and Isaac's full reply appear in a voters guide published before the March 2018 party primaries by the League of Women Voters of Texas and League of Women Voters Austin Area.",
      "Katie Tahuahua of Isaac's campaign, asked the basis of Isaac's claim about black deaths, responded by email that according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease caused the deaths of the most U.S. black residents in 2015 (75,249). She noted that the year before, according to CDC figures representing data from 47 states, over 200,000 \"black babies were aborted.\" Upshot: \"This is far more than the leading reported cause of death for black Americans,\" Tahuahua wrote.",
      "We'll unpack those figures. But it's worth noting for starters that Isaac's characterization of abortions as killing babies is disputed.",
      "Abortion rights advocates, noting the Supreme Court legalized abortion in every state in 1973, typically refer to unborn fetuses. Also, the CDC doesn't say abortions kill babies; it defines a \"legal induced abortion\" as \"an intervention performed by a licensed clinician (e.g., a physician, nurse-midwife, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant) that is intended to terminate an ongoing pregnancy.\" In addition, an unknown share of aborted pregnancies wouldn't have resulted in live children, due to the natural risk of miscarriages and stillbirths.",
      "Causes of death",
      "We confirmed from a CDC table pointed out by Tahuahua that heart disease killed the most black residents (75,249) in 2015 and also was the leading cause of death for all Americans. Lesser causes of death for black Americans included cancer, stroke and diabetes, the table indicates. The table doesn't list abortion as a cause.",
      "Our own search of CDC-posted statistics led us to a table stating that nationally in 2015, 6,907 black infants died. Among the table's 15 listed leading causes of death, disorders related to short gestation and birth weight accounted for the most deaths, 1,513, nearly 22 percent of the total. The table lists congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities as the second most-prevalent cause, accounting for 930 deaths, nearly 14 percent of the total. The table doesn't list abortion as a cause.",
      "Abortions by ethnicity",
      "Tahuahua said Isaac got to his declaration of more than 1,000 black child deaths a day because the CDC \"reports that 35% of aborted babies are black.\"",
      "For our part, we confirmed that the CDC says that in 2014, there were 652,639 legal induced abortions nationally. Apply the 35 percent figure offered by Isaac and it looks like black women obtained 228,423 abortions for a rate of 626 a day.",
      "Then again, Tahuahua noted, the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and abortion rights, separately estimated 926,200 U.S. abortions in 2014 which, if you apply Isaac's methodology, signals that black women obtained 324,170 abortions for a rate of 888 a day.",
      "The Guttmacher count of abortions appears in a January 2018 institute \"Fact Sheet\" that also says that white patients accounted for 39 percent of U.S. abortion procedures in 2014, blacks for 28 percent, Hispanics for 25 percent and patients of other races and ethnicities for 9 percent, according to an institute survey of abortion patients.",
      "Applying the institute's 28 percent figure to the institute's abortion count suggests that black women obtained 259,336 abortions for a rate of 711 a day.",
      "The institute's May 2016 recap of its survey results also walks through the proportion of abortion patients in given subgroups (e.g., a particular age-group) relative to the proportion of all U.S. women aged 15 44 who are in that same subgroup--what the authors call an \"abortion index.\" By this metric, the recap says, white \"women were slightly underrepresented among abortion patients in 2014, having an abortion index of 0.7, while black women were substantially overrepresented, with a relative abortion rate of 1.9. Hispanic women were slightly overrepresented among abortion patients in 2014 (1.2).\"",
      "Institute: Black women experience higher rates of unintended pregnancy",
      "The institute's Rebecca Wind, responding to our query about Isaac's claim, said by email that higher abortion rates among black women reflect higher rates of unintended pregnancy.",
      "A 2008 institute paper by Susan A. Cohen states: \"These higher unintended pregnancy rates reflect the particular difficulties that many women in minority communities face in accessing high-quality contraceptive services and in using their chosen method of birth control consistently and effectively over long periods of time.\"",
      "As of 2004, Cohen wrote, about one-third of abortions were obtained by white women with 37 percent obtained by black women. Overall, she wrote, \"black women are three times as likely as white women to experience an unintended pregnancy; Hispanic women are twice as likely. Because black women experience so many more unintended pregnancies than any other group sharply disproportionate to their numbers in the general population they are more likely to seek out and obtain abortion services than any other group,\" Cohen wrote. \"In addition, because black women as a group want the same number of children as white women, but have so many more unintended pregnancies, they are more likely than white women to terminate an unintended pregnancy by abortion to avoid an unwanted birth,\" Cohen wrote.",
      "We circled back to Isaac about our findings. He replied by email: \"You're correct that the CDC identifies heart disease as the #1 cause of death for black Americans; however, were abortion considered a cause of death, it would be the #1 cause by far.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Isaac told the voters guide that abortion is \"the leading cause of death for black Americans and kills as many as 1,000 black children every day.\"",
      "Opinions about this claim likely divide over Isaac's definition of a fetus as a child--and by Isaac's reasoning, we find this claim has an element of truth in that black women in 2014 accounted for about 711 U.S. abortions a day.",
      "In fact, however, heart disease was the leading cause of death for black and other Americans in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency didn't list the abortion procedure among causes of death.",

      "In Ohio, where union workers are a major presence and the manufacturing economy is hurting, Sen. Barack Obama attacked Sen. Hillary Clinton for her position on the North American Free Trade Agreement, called NAFTA.",
      "\"Yesterday, Sen. Clinton also said I'm wrong to point out that she once supported NAFTA,\" Obama said. \"But the fact is, she was saying great things about NAFTA until she started running for president. A couple years after it passed, she said NAFTA was a 'free and fair trade agreement' and that it was 'proving its worth.' And in 2004, she said, 'I think, on balance, NAFTA has been good for New York state and America.' \"",
      "The Clinton campaign says Obama is wrong, that Clinton was critical of NAFTA \"long before she started running for president.\"",
      "We looked into Clinton's past remarks on NAFTA and concluded that she has changed her tune, from once speaking favorably about it to now saying the agreement needs \"fixing.\"",
      "The agreement goes back to the 1992 presidential campaign when Bill Clinton ran against incumbent President George H.W. Bush. On Aug. 12 of that year, Bush finished negotiating NAFTA with Mexico and Canada. During the campaign, Bill Clinton said he would support NAFTA if elected, but would demand supplemental agreements to protect worker rights, the environment and sudden import surges.",
      "After Clinton won the presidency, his administration negotiated the side agreements and made NAFTA one of its top priorities. Vice President Al Gore memorably debated Ross Perot about NAFTA on CNN's \"Larry King Live.\" Congress approved the agreements, and it was hailed as a major political victory for the new president.",
      "As first lady, Hillary Clinton publicly supported her husband's position. In 1996, in a visit with unionized garment workers, she said the words Obama now quotes. \"I think everybody is in favor of free and fair trade. I think NAFTA is proving its worth,\" said Clinton, according to an Associated Press report.",
      "Clinton wrote positively of her husband's efforts on NAFTA in her memoir \"Living History,\" published in 2003:",
      "\"Creating a free trade zone in North America the largest free trade zone in the world would expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization. Although unpopular with labor unions, expanding trade opportunities was an important administration goal.\"",
      "During a 2004 teleconference on funding cuts for job training, Clinton was asked whether NAFTA should be revisited. She replied, \"I think that we have to enforce the trade rules that are inherent\" in NAFTA. \"I think on balance NAFTA has been good for New York and America, but I also think that there are a number of areas where we're not dealt with in an upfront way in dealing with our friend to the north, Canada, which seems to be able to come up with a number of rationales for keeping New York agricultural products out of Canada,\" she said.",
      "Today, Clinton's campaign Web site says plainly, \"NAFTA was negotiated more than 14 years ago, and Hillary believes it has not lived up to its promises.\"",
      "At a debate hosted by CNN in November 2007, Clinton said, \"NAFTA was a mistake to the extent that it did not deliver on what we had hoped it would, and that's why I call for a trade timeout.\"",
      "We should note that Clinton biographer Sally Bedell Smith has said that as first lady, Clinton opposed NAFTA privately but supported it publicly because it was important to her husband politically. However, this is not a point Clinton made in her own autobiography, where she wrote in favor of NAFTA.",
      "Now, there's the issue of whether Clinton changed her mind because she was running for president. Clinton surrogates say she made remarks against NAFTA as early as March 2000 when she was running for Senate in New York. We could not confirm those remarks independently.

Keep in mind that experts estimated there were 6.8 million uninsured illegal immigrants in the United States in 2007, out of a total of 11.9 million illegal immigrants. Right now, there are laws on the books that require hospitals to treat severely ill people who arrive at the hospital, regardless of immigration status, and we didn't see anything that would change those laws, either.",
      "Most illegal immigrants are also now excluded from Medicaid, the government-run health care for the poor. We didn't see anything that would change that.",
      "One place where the bill does mention immigration status is for \"affordability credits.\" These are tax credits for people of modest means need to buy health insurance. The credits would help them buy insurance on a national health insurance exchange. The bill specifically says that people in the United States illegally are not eligible for tax credits, on page 132, section 242.",

      "One of the most detailed responses was from the anti-immigration group Federation for American Immigration Reform, called FAIR. You can read their statement on the matter on their Web site.",
      "Primarily, they argue that illegal immigrants would be permitted to purchase insurance on the national health insurance exchange because the bill does not include a mechanism for verifying citizenship. So illegal immigrants would have the chance to purchase insurance in the public option, a government-run health care plan that would offer basic coverage at a low price.",
      "FAIR also argues for more robust verification measures for the affordability credit and making sure that illegal immigrant parents won't be able to receive coverage if their citizen children are eligible.",
      "FAIR has a point that illegal immigrants would likely be able to buy insurance on the national health insurance exchange. We don't see anything in the bills that would hinder that. A Congressional Research Service report issued Aug. 25, 2009, confirmed our observation. The House bill \"does not contain any restrictions on noncitzens participating in the Exchange whether the noncitizens are legally or illegally present, or in the United States temporarily or permanently,\" the report said.",
      "But it's worth pointing out that illegal immigrants participating in the exchange would be paying for their insurance like everyone else. That's similar to the current system we're not aware of any particular restrictions that stop illegal immigrants from buying private insurance now. Under health care reform, illegal immigrants would be able to buy private insurance or the public option.",
      "When we look at all of this evidence, it seems that health reform leaves in place the status quo on illegal immigration, and certainly does not provide any new benefits particularly for illegal immigrants. We hope to look at this issue more in the days ahead, because some hospitals are concerned about recouping their costs for treating illegal immigrants, and we're curious to know more about that problem and how it might or might not be solved by reform.",
      "The best argument that we find that health reform would help illegal immigrants is that some might be able to purchase the public option if it passes, and it might not on the new health insurance exchange. They would purchase that at full cost. Obama said, \"The reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally,\" which Wilson said was a \"lie.\" Actually, Obama can make a pretty thorough case that reform doesn't apply to those here illegally. We don't find the public option argument enough to make the case that Obama \"lied.\" We rate Wilson's statement False."

      "If you've got liberal friends and logged into Facebook lately, chances are pretty good that you've seen this chart. As people express their support with the Occupy Wall Street protests, they are citing this chart and similar statistics to show income inequality in the United States. The chart -- here's another version posted on the liberal website Daily Kos -- lists the ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay in the U.S. and nine other countries. The smallest ratio is Japan's at 11 to 1. The United States is highest at 475 to 1. We've gotten many reader requests to check the numbers, in part because the chart lacks any sourcing or additional explanatory information. But despite the lack of backup information, the chart has gone viral. It's not only been posted and re-posted many times on Facebook, it's also appeared in countless blogs and been tweeted and re-tweeted on Twitter. The chart is the latest reminder that factual claims can spread at lightning speed on the Internet -- even when the facts to back them up are scarce. Before we check the accuracy of the numbers, it's worth exploring where the chart began and how it went viral. It's been repeatedly cited in blogs and reports, including one paper presented at a conference of a United Nations affiliate. The paper, written by Thomas Prosser of the Industrial Relations Research Unit at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom, included the same chart that's now circulating, which it sourced to a 2005 paper by an M. Kroll titled, \"CEO Pay Rates: U.S. vs Foreign Nations.\" We located a scanned version of the paper on the Internet, and it did appear to be written by Prof. Mark Kroll. His institution wasn't listed, but after some additional searching, we found that Kroll had been teaching at the Louisiana Tech College of Business in 2005 and that he is now the business dean at the University of Texas at Brownsville. But it turns out he didn't write the paper after all. \"Actually, I am the recipient' of the paper you refer to,\" Kroll told us in an e-mail. \"The paper was done as a class project by three of my students in a graduate class back in 2005. The 475-to-1 ratio that you reference is listed in a table in the paper the students wrote. They do not give a specific citation for the data in the table.\" The paper's cover sheet fooled us -- as it fooled others -- because the professor's name appears in the middle of the page, and the three students' names appear together at the bottom in a less prominent spot. We tried to reach the co-authors -- Adam Choate, Dana Rowzee and Jerrod Tinsley, all of whom were working on their Master of Business Administration in 2005 -- but we did not hear back. So how about the substance of the chart? From previous fact-checks, we knew that American CEOs are generously paid, and we had confirmed that for ordinary Americans, incomes are stagnating. But on the specific comparison of CEO pay and average-worker pay, we found two liberal groups -- the Economic Policy Institute and the Institute for Policy Studies -- that have produced long-running studies of this question. The most recent chart from the Economic Policy Institute shows a ratio of 185 to 1 for 2009. According to the group's calculations, the peak since the mid 1960s was almost 299 to 1. But it was never as high as high as 475 to 1. Meanwhile, the most recent ratio from the Institute for Policy Studies is also smaller -- for 2010, it was 325 to 1. In previous years the ratio on two occasions has exceeded 475 to 1 -- to be specific, 516 to 1 in 1999 and 525 to 1 in 2000. The Institute for Policy Studies' ratios are higher than the Economic Policy Institute's due to methodological differences. Sarah Anderson, who has co-authored the Institute for Policy Studies reports, said the figures can vary depending on several factors, including which CEOs are sampled and what types of compensation for both the CEO and the worker are used in the calculation. Still, both of the years where the CEO pay ratio in the IPS study was at least 475 to 1 came more than a decade ago, so data from those years would be of questionable use to policy debates today. In addition, neither of the two groups that compiled these figures made comparisons of CEO-to-worker pay across different countries, as the chart circulating on Facebook does. So what we're left with is an unsourced, undated chart with numbers that, at best, were only correct (approximately) in 1999 and 2000 according to one measure, and wrong according to a different measure. Anderson of the Institute for Policy Studies said that for a paper written in 2005, a 475 to 1 ratio was not \"crazy high,\" since the figure for 2004 in her group's study was 431 to 1. Kroll, the professor who graded the paper, added that \"it would not surprise me if (the students') number was in the ball park.'\" Still, that argument doesn't help today's social-media posters. The data they're circulating is at best six years old, and the ratios have fallen since then. Our ruling This is a textbook example of how claims can spiral out of control on the Internet. Just as conservatives have circulated unfounded claims about President Barack Obama's birth certificate, liberals are spreading this questionable chart. We don't doubt the chart's underlying point that the ratio of CEO pay to worker pay is high in the United States, and is likely higher in our free-wheeling economy than it is in the historically more egalitarian nations of Europe. But in its claim that the U.S. ratio is 475 to 1, the chart conveys a sense of certitude and statistical precision that simply isn't warranted -- and which is contradicted by the facts. The latest number for the U.S. is 185 to 1 in one study and 325 to 1 in another -- and those numbers were not generated by groups that might have an ideological interest in downplaying the gaps between rich and poor. We rate the claim on the U.S. ratio False.",

    "body-text": [
      "In the wake of the mass shooting in Aurora, Colo., Americans took to social media to express their views on guns and violence. A reader sent us one Facebook post about the extent of gun violence in the United States. It said, \"USA is #1 in gun violence. Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That's 270 people a day and 87 dead because of gun violence every day.\" In this item, we'll look at the second half of that claim: \"Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That's 270 people a day and 87 dead.\" The numbers We turned to statistics from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; experts in the field told us it keeps the most reliable statistics on the subject. The CDC collects two sets of relevant data. The first is data for deaths by guns, which is included in an annual report about deaths of all types during calendar year 2009. The numbers for gun deaths is broken down into several categories: Suicide: 18,735 deaths Homicide: 11,493 deaths Unintentional: 554 deaths Legal interventions: 333 deaths Undetermined: 232 deaths Total: 31,347 deaths The second data set tracks non-fatal injuries by guns. According to the CDC, there were 73,505 non-fatal firearm injuries in 2010. (We will ignore an additional 13,851 non-fatal injuries from BB or pellet guns.) How accurate is the Facebook post? If you add together the gun deaths and the non-fatal gun injuries, you get 104,852 people shot every year. That's very close to what the Facebook post said. The Facebook post was also close in its daily averages -- 287 people shot every day, and 86 deaths by gun every day. There's one area, however, in which the Facebook post could have benefited from additional context. It says that \"nearly 100,000 people get shot every year,\" which to us suggests that a victim is being shot by someone else. In reality, a significant majority of gun deaths comes from self-inflicted firearm wounds. If you ignore the suicides -- and if you assume that relatively few people survive a suicide attempt with a firearm (we couldn't find any hard data on that question) -- then the number of people who got shot, either fatally or non-fatally, was about 86,000, or roughly 235 a day. That's lower than the Facebook post indicated. And the daily number of firearm deaths would be substantially lower -- 35 per day, rather than the 87 cited in the Facebook post. Our ruling The numbers in the Facebook post are close to accurate, as long as you make one major assumption -- that suicides count as \"get(ting) shot.\" We think that assumption is debatable, but there is no question that at least 100,000 people did die or become injured from firearms. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly True."

    "body-image": [],
    "body-text": [
      "President Barack Obama's re-election campaign released a new ad aimed at women on June 21, 2012. Here's the narration: \"The son of a single mom, proud father of two daughters, President Obama knows that women being paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men isn't just unfair, it hurts families. So the first law he signed was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to help ensure that women are paid the same as men for doing the exact same work. Because President Obama knows that fairness for women means a stronger middle class for America.\" In this item, we're checking the claim that \"women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men.\" The 77 cent figure has become a rallying cry for those who seek to eliminate employment discrimination based on gender. And it's a genuine statistic. In a report released in September 2011, the U.S. Census Bureau wrote that in 2010, the female-to-male earnings ratio of full-time, year-round workers was 0.77.\" Translated into dollars, that means that in 2010, women working full-time earned 77 cents for every dollar earned by men working full time. But the Obama ad takes a solid statistic and describes it incorrectly. The campaign is wrong to say that the 77-cent figure describes the pay differences between men and women \"doing the same work.\" (By contrast, former Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine recently earned a Mostly True on a similar claim because he was not specifying the number was for the same occupations.) The 77-cent figure compares all male and female workers, regardless of their occupation. Whether due to a historical legacy of discrimination or because of personal choice, women and men are disproportionately represented in certain jobs. For instance, women dominate the ranks of receptionists, nurses, and elementary and middle-school teachers, among other fields. Men are disproportionately truck drivers, managers and computer software engineers. \"If more men tend to be employed in occupations that pay higher wages both to men and women, then men may enjoy an overall earnings advantage even if all women in each occupation receive exactly the same hourly pay as the men who are employed in the occupation,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. Indeed, if you look at men and women working in the same professions, the pay gap is much smaller (though for most professions, it doesn't disappear entirely). For computer programmers, for instance, women earn 95 cents for every dollar a man earns. For cashiers it's 92 cents. For cooks and customer service representatives, it's 95 cents. Other occupations have more unequal ratios. Women who are personal financial advisers, for instance, earn just 58 cents of what men in that job earn. (The statistics come from the Institute for Women's Policy Research, a think tank focusing on women's issues.) There are at least two other factors that weaken the accuracy of the ad's claim. One involves hours worked. While calculations that led to the 77-cent figure did not include any part-time workers, the label \"full time worker\" can actually be applied to employees with a wide range of hours worked per week. The official Bureau of Labor Statistics definition of a full-time worker is someone who works at least 35 hours per week. Someone who gets no vacation time and works 40 hours a week for 52 weeks would work 2,080 hours in a year. By contrast, a worker on a 36-hour-per-week schedule who has two weeks off would work only 1,800 hours. Meanwhile, a worker with two weeks off who averaged four hours per week of overtime would end up with 2,200 hours. \"Some workers have even longer work schedules than that, especially when the economy is expanding rapidly,\" Burtless said. \"So even among full-time, year-round workers, there is considerable variability in annual work hours.\" This variation can work its way into the gender pay gap if women seek more flexible schedules or if men happen to fill jobs with greater opportunities for overtime. (PolitiFact has noted that Burtless contributed $750 to Obama's campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) The other complicating factor involves seniority on the job. Men have typically held their jobs longer than women in the same position. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, men in 2010 who were between 45 and 54 years old had a median job tenure of 8.5 years, compared to 7.1 years for women in the same age group. \"Women have shorter job tenures than men because they have more work interruptions than men, usually because they have children and assume heavy responsibility for rearing those children,\" Burtless said. Improving access to child care or offering stronger protections for workers who leave the workforce temporarily to raise children, as some other advanced industrialized nations do, would probably decrease the wage gap, Burtless said. When we contacted the Obama campaign, they reiterated the importance of the overall figures and noted a Bloomberg analysis that showed that only one occupation out of 265 with more than 10,000 men and women employed did women out-earn men -- namely, \"personal care and service workers, which include butlers, valets, house sitters and shoe shiners.\" \"No matter how you look at it, women make less than men -- at the same job, at different jobs, weekly, annually and by occupation,\" said Kara Carscaden, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign. Nothing in our analysis suggests that gender discrimination doesn't exist. In fact, the experts we consulted agreed that no matter how much you adjust the models to equalize for outside factors, a difference in pay between men and women remains, and it's one that can't be explained away. Still, those same experts also agreed that ad goes too far in claiming that the 77-cent statistic describes the pay gap for women \"doing the same work as men.\" \"Sexism may explain differences in occupation, industry, education, hours and weeks worked, so it's hard to know how much of the gap is due to discrimination. But (77 cents) isn't the right statistic for saying the same work as,'\" said Betsey Stevenson, a business and public policy professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and visiting economics professor at Princeton University who previously served as chief economist for Obama's labor secretary. Burtless agreed. \"It's hard to defend the last seven words in the ad's claim.\" Our ruling The Obama campaign took a legitimate statistic and described it in a way that makes it sound much more dramatic than it actually is. The 77-cent figure is real, but it does not factor in occupations held, hours worked or length of tenure. Describing that statistic as referring to the pay for women \"doing the same work as men\" earns it a rating of Mostly False.",

      "Are Democratic presidents better than Republican presidents at job creation? Former President Bill Clinton said so -- forcefully -- in his speech to the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte.",
      "\"Since 1961, for 52 years now, the Republicans have held the White House 28 years, the Democrats 24,\" Clinton said. \"In those 52 years, our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs. So what's the jobs score? Republicans 24 million, Democrats 42 (million).\" In the packed convention hall, it was one of the night's biggest applause lines.",
      "In 2010, we checked a similar claim from Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., who said that Democratic presidents \"have been considerably more effective at creating private-sector jobs.\" After crunching the numbers back to President Harry Truman, we found that jobs did indeed grow faster under Democratic presidents when adjusted for a president's years served in office. So we rated the claim True.",
      "Clinton's claim at the convention was worded differently, so we quickly re-crunched the numbers based on his specifications.",
      "Let's cut to the chase. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, here are the net increases in private-sector employment under each president, chronologically by party:",
      "Republicans Richard Nixon: Increase of 7.1 million jobs Gerald Ford: Increase of 1.3 million jobs Ronald Reagan: Increase of 14.7 million jobs George H.W. Bush: Increase of 1.5 million jobs George W. Bush: Decline of 646,000 jobs Total: Increase of 23.9 million jobs under Republican presidents Democrats John F. Kennedy: Increase of 2.7 million jobs Lyndon B. Johnson: Increase of 9.5 million jobs Jimmy Carter: Increase of 9.0 million jobs Bill Clinton: Increase of 20.8 million jobs Barack Obama: Increase of 332,000 jobs",
      "Total: Increase of 42.3 million jobs.",
      "So Clinton is right. But we'll bring up a few points worth noting.",
      "This does not include government jobs",
      "The combination of private-sector jobs and public-sector jobs is a broader measurement of job creation than private-sector alone. But excluding government jobs would presumably hurt Democrats more than Republicans, given the two parties' historical stances toward the role of government. The fact that Democrats finished so far ahead despite taking government jobs off the table makes it a more impressive accomplishment.",
      "The Democrats didn't benefit from population growth",
      "For our previous story, Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless calculated that the U.S. working-age population actually grew slightly faster under Republican presidents, also making the Democratic accomplishment more impressive.",
      "Presidents deserves less credit for the good times and less blame for the bad times",
      "It's a truism of politics that when things go well, the president generally gets too much credit, and when things don't go well, the president usually gets too much blame. Shouldn't the Republican Congress of 1995-2001 get a share of the credit for Clinton's robust job growth? Shouldn't the Democratic House that served under Reagan? Most experts would say yes and yes.",
      "Since we published our previous story, we have changed our policy: We now factor into our ratings whether the politician or party deserves credit or blame for the statistical trend being analyzed. In this item, though, we will not factor in credit or blame, because both parties have had presidents serve during the time we looked at, meaning that both parties would have benefited and suffered in roughly equal proportions.",
      "It's unclear how much this finding says about our political and economic systems",
      "Job creation for each president depended to a certain extent on timing, external factors and luck. And as Yale political scientist David Mayhew pointed out for our previous story, conclusions drawn from a relatively narrow data set -- in this case, just 12 postwar presidencies -- need to be taken with a grain of salt.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Clinton's figures check out, and they also mirror the broader results we came up with two years ago. Partisans are free to interpret these findings as they wish, but on the numbers, Clinton's right. We rate his claim True.",

      "In his speech at the Democratic National Committee in Charlotte, N.C., President Barack Obama mocked Republicans for turning to tax cuts as the solution to every problem. \"Have a surplus? Try a tax cut. Deficit too high? Try another. Feel a cold coming on? Take two tax cuts, roll back some regulations, and call us in the morning!\" Obama said. \"Now, I've cut taxes for those who need it middle-class families and small businesses. But I don't believe that another round of tax breaks for millionaires will bring good jobs to our shores, or pay down our deficit,\" Obama said. Obama is often accused by Republicans of raising taxes, and he has raised some taxes during his presidency. He's also said that he intends to raise income tax rates for couples who make more than $250,000 a year or single people who make more than $200,000 a year. Here, we're going to look at his claim to cut taxes for \"middle-class families and small businesses.\" (We've been tracking all of Obama's campaign promises about taxes on our Obameter.) Obama has signed off on two major tax cuts for middle-class families: the Making Work Pay tax credit that was part of the economic stimulus of 2009 and a temporary reduction in Social Security payroll taxes that went into effect in 2011. As part of the stimulus, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, single workers collected a $400 tax credit, and working couples got $800. The credit didn't come in the form of a check; it worked out so that most workers had about $400 less in federal income taxes withheld from their paychecks spread out over the entire year. Most workers received a tax cut under that plan, with the exception of some high earners. The tax cuts phased out for couples who make more than $250,000 or a single person making over $200,000, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center . The result mirrored what Obama promised he would do on the campaign. Obama pledged tax cuts of $500 for each worker and $1,000 for working couples. We rated the promise a Compromise on our Obameter because the resulting tax cut was a little lower than what Obama wanted. That tax cut expired at the end of 2011. But Obama won another round of tax cuts for most workers in a December 2010 tax deal with Republicans in Congress. Those tax cuts -- a temporary reduction in worker's payroll taxes, worth about 2 percent of total earnings -- expire in 2013. Again, the tax cut didn't come as a check, but gives workers a little more in their paychecks than they would have otherwise. Obama also has passed an array of tax cuts for small businesses. Eight of them were included in the stimulus, the Affordable Care Act (also known as the health care law), and the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (also known as the HIRE Act). Among the cuts were the exclusion of up to 75 percent of capital gains on key small business investments; a tax credit for the cost of health insurance for small business employees and new tax credits for hiring Americans out of work for at least two months. Another eight cuts came via the Small Business Jobs Act, signed by Obama in September of 2010. These included: adding deductions for business cell phone use; creating a new deduction for health care costs for the self-employed; allowing greater deductions for business start-up expenses; eliminating taxes on all capital gains from key small business investments, and raising the small business expense limit to $500,000. Three months later, the president signed a tax bill that raised the expense limit to 100 percent of small business new investments until the end of 2011. It also extended the elimination of capital gains taxes for small business investments through the end of 2012. (For more details, see our previous fact-check that provided at least 16 tax cuts to small businesses; we rated it Mostly True.) To be clear, this doesn't mean the middle-class and small businesses haven't seen any tax increases under the Obama administration. We rated his campaign promise that no family making less than $250,000 will see \"any form of tax increase\" as Promise Broken. Obama has signed off on new taxes on cigarettes and indoor tanning. His health care law includes a tax penalty for people who don't buy health insurance; that starts in 2014. (It includes hardship exemptions for people who can't find affordable policies.) Also, under the health care law, small businesses that have more than 50 employees that don't offer their employees health insurance could face fines. Our ruling Obama has raised some taxes during his presidency, but he's also pursued broad-based tax cuts for the middle class and small businesses. We particularly give weight here to the tax cuts that were part of the stimulus and the payroll tax holiday, which reduced taxes for broad swaths of the workforce. Some small businesses may have been hit by new taxes that were part of Obama's health law, but these would depend on the particular circumstances of each business. Also, there were new taxes on cigarettes and indoor tanning. Obama said he has \"cut taxes for those who need it middle-class families, small businesses.\" He has, but he also has raised some taxes. So while his statement is accurate, it lacks that additional context. We rate his claim Mostly True."

      "We thought we'd take a closer look.",
      "Here's how the calculation is made, using Census Bureau population estimates and employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics:",
      "The total U.S. population age 16 and over is at least 243 million. Subtracting the nearly 156 million Americans in the labor force in June 2013 -- that is, those who were either working or looking for work -- leaves 87 million Americans, which is close to 90 million.",
      "However, the 90 million number is padded, since this number includes a lot of Americans who wouldn't be expected to be working. Specifically:",
      "People age 16 to 17, who likely are in high school: 9 million",
      "People who are enrolled in either two- or four-year colleges: 21 million",
      "People age 65 and older, who have reached retirement age: 40 million people",
      "That means 20 million people are of normal working age, not in college and not working. That's less than one-quarter the amount repeatedly cited in the blogosphere.",
      "So the 90 million number is exaggerated. Even so, the idea that fewer people are joining the workforce is something that worries economists.",
      "All things being equal, economists like to see more people working because it helps economic growth (though not at the expense of dropping out of school, which can limit future employment opportunities and earnings potential).",
      "To gauge these trends, economists can calculate the labor force participation rate, which is the percentage of the population that is either working or looking for work, and they can calculate the employment to population ratio, which is the percentage of the 16-and-over population that is currently employed. Both statistics generally track each other, but not in lockstep.",

      "As more adults begin moving into retirement age, the percentage of Americans who work is bound to decline. And that's been happening in a big way as the baby boomers age. Burtless has determined that the two employment ratios would have fallen in recent years just on the basis of aging, even if there had been no recession. But the age-related decline has been worsened by high unemployment rates during the recession.",
      "Most troubling, economists say, is the decline among the core working ages of 25 to 55. In addition, the tight job market has convinced more people to opt out of the labor market, perhaps by becoming students or stay-at-home parents.",

      "A meme circulating on Twitter and other social media recently caught our eye. Created by the liberal group Occupy Democrats, it said, \"97 percent of the 100 poorest counties in America are in red states. But tell me again how Republican policies grow the economy?\"",
      "This was a variation on a few memes we've checked previously -- that nine out of the 10 poorest states are red states (we rated this Mostly True) and that Republican-leaning states get more in federal dollars than they pay in taxes (also Mostly True).",
      "While the meme's suggestion that \"Republican policies\" are causing poverty is too subjective a question to be fact-checked, we decided to take a closer look at the set-up to the claim -- that \"97 percent of the 100 poorest counties in America are in red states.\"",
      "First, we'll explain our methodology.",
      "To determine the nation's 100 poorest counties, we downloaded data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey. This data covers five years ending in 2012, and includes more than 3,000 counties and county equivalents (such as Louisiana parishes). This data enabled us to rank-order these jurisdictions based on two commonly used measurements -- median income, and percentage of the population in poverty.",
      "As for determining whether a state is \"red\" or \"blue,\" we decided to define it by whether the state voted for President Barack Obama or Mitt Romney in 2012. This means we counted North Carolina and Indiana as red states, since Obama lost them in 2012 after winning them in 2008. (Though either way, the differences would have been marginal.)",
      "So how did the data turn out?",
      "For median income, we found that 95 of the 100 poorest counties were located in red states. Here are the 10 poorest, all of them in red states:",
      "1. Owsley County, Ky.",
      "2. Jefferson County, Miss.",
      "3. Wolfe County, Ky.",
      "4. Brooks County, Texas",
      "5. McCreary County, Ky.",
      "6. Hudspeth County, Texas",
      "7. Hancock County, Tenn.",
      "8. Jackson County, Ky.",
      "9. Clay County, Ky.",
      "10. Holmes County, Miss.",
      "For percentage of residents in poverty, we found that 93 of the 100 poorest counties were in red states.",
      "Here are the 10 with the highest poverty rates, all of them in red states:",
      "1. Shannon County, S.D.",
      "2. Clay County, Ga.",
      "3. East Carroll Parish, La.",
      "4. Sioux County, N.D.",
      "5. Todd County, S.D.",
      "6. Hudspeth County, Texas",
      "7. Holmes County, Miss.",
      "8. Corson County, S.D.",
      "9. Wolfe County, Ky.",
      "10. Humphreys County, Miss.",
      "So there are some differences between the most recent Census data and what the meme said, but they are pretty small. Numerically, we don't have much to quibble with.",
      "Our bigger question concerns whether it's significant that a lot of poor counties are located in red states. There's reason for at least a bit of skepticism.",
      "For starters, the list is dominated by rural areas. Generally speaking, rural areas have a lower cost of living, so the small income you make in a poor, rural Texas county is going to go further than it would if you lived in a poor, urban area like Detroit or Camden, N.J. This raises questions about how comparatively disadvantaged poor Americans are in rural and urban areas.",
      "Also, rural areas are areas where Republicans tend to do well electorally. By contrast, impoverished areas of big cities are big enough population-wise to be balanced by more affluent neighborhoods, and these poor urban areas are often (though not always) in blue states.",
      "It's also worth pointing out that many of the counties on the list are located in Appalachia, particularly in such states as Kentucky, West Virginia, Mississippi and Georgia. That's a region that has suffered economically for generations -- long predating the time when Republicans took over from Democrats in most elected offices.",
      "In Appalachia, \"it's clear there's a regional problem, born of isolation, geographic and political; exploitation, of timber and coal; and poor education,\" said Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky.",
      "Finally, there's an eccentricity that shaped both of the top-100 lists. Each is dominated by three states: Texas, Georgia and Kentucky. What ties together these three states? They have a lot of counties. In fact, these three states rank first, second and third on the list of states that have the most counties. Texas has 254, Georgia 159 and Kentucky 120.",
      "This means that these three states have lots of rural, small-population counties, so they take up a disproportionate share of the spots on these lists. On each list, these three states collectively account for more than 40 percent of the counties listed.",
      "Importantly, each of these three states are red states. If some of the bigger blue states had been sliced into as many counties as Texas, Georgia and Kentucky were, some of those blue-state counties might have been poor and rural, and that could have changed the complexion of the list. As it is, blue states tend to have smaller numbers of counties. New York has 62, California has 57, Washington state has 39, Oregon has 36, New Jersey has 21 and Massachusetts has just 14.",
      "Our ruling",
      "The meme said that \"97 percent of the 100 poorest counties in America are in red states.\" According to the most recent data, that's a few percentage points high, but not by much.",
      "However, measuring a county's lack of affluence this way skews the map of poorest places toward rural states (which tend to be red) and away from big cities (which tend to be blue). This undercuts the simplicity of the meme's political message.",

      "\"You have no reason to remember, but we came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt,\" Clinton said. \"We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to piece together the resources for mortgages for houses, for Chelsea's education. It was not easy. Bill has worked really hard. And it's been amazing to me. He's worked very hard.\"",

These forms only show amounts in broad ranges -- from $15,001 to $50,000, from $50,001 to $100,000 and so forth -- but under any set of assumptions, the Clintons were in the red, a problem driven by Bill Clinton's enormous legal bills.",
      "Their highest possible assets totaled about $1.8 million, while their lowest possible debts were nearly $2.3 million. The most optimistic scenario left them in a hole of about $500,000.",
      "But the federal disclosure form does not include homes used for personal use and the Clintons owned two. In 1999, they bought a five-bedroom home in Chappaqua, N.Y., for $1.7 million. In December 2000, just as they were leaving the White House, they bought a seven-bedroom house near Embassy Row in Washington, D.C. The price was $2.85 million.",
      "While those homes had mortgages, which would increase the amount of the Clintons' debt, the family also had equity in them. The New York Times reported that the Clintons put $855,000 down on the Washington house, for instance. That equity would have covered the low-end debt estimate of about $500,000.",

      "We reached out to Hillary Clinton's office for more details and did not hear back.",
      "Were they dead broke?",
      "All this begs the question of whether someone who can afford to buy a $2.85 million house is \"dead broke.\" We reached two accounting professors at Ohio State University's Fisher College of Business, one of the top-ranked schools in the country. Assistant Professor Jeffrey Hoopes said to call the Clintons dead broke would be a stretch for how the term is commonly understood.",
      "\"Almost any president leaving office can expect tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars of future earnings as a result of their having been president,\" Hoopes said. \"Speaking, consulting, board positions, and so on, are all very lucrative.\"",
      "Professor Brian Mittendorf said a balance sheet of assets and liabilities simply doesn't paint a complete picture. Mittendorf compared the Clintons to a medical school graduate saddled with huge debts but with the prospect of a very hefty income down the line.",
      "\"While one can claim to be technically broke, creditors wouldn't take it as such as long as future income streams could cover the liabilities,\" Mittendorf said.",
      "In December 2000, at least one large bank saw the Clintons through that lens. Whatever their balance sheet might have been, Citibank lent them $1.995 million to buy that house in Washington, D.C. This was a safe loan. By Feb. 5, 2001, Bill Clinton was commanding regular speaking fees of $125,000 or more.",
      "Hillary Clinton herself did quite well in 2001. The book publisher Simon and Schuster paid her $2.84 million in royalties.",
      "By 2004, the Clintons had erased their debts and Hillary Clinton was ranked the 10th-wealthiest member of the Senate, with a net worth between $10 million and $50 million.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Hillary Clinton said she and Bill were in debt and dead broke when they left the White House. The public record shows that they possibly had more liabilities than assets, but it doesn't show that conclusively. More important, a balance sheet does not tell the full story and the experts we reached said the Clintons' earning potential had a real economic value that the financial sector traditionally acknowledges and is willing to bank on.",
      "A few weeks before they left the White House, the Clintons were able to muster a cash down payment of $855,000 and secure a $1.995 million mortgage. This hardly fits the common meaning of \"dead broke.\"",

      "As the U.S. House of Representatives was readying a new special committee to investigate the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, many Democrats were arguing that continuing to probe the Sept. 11, 2012, attack -- which killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens -- amounted to a political witch hunt.",
      "On May 5, 2014, Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., told MSNBC host Ed Schultz that there has already been exhaustive testimony and investigation of the incident.",
      "\"This thing is just going on and on to boredom actually,\" Garamendi said. \"The Armed Services Committee actually did a hearing and the result was there's nothing here. That's obviously a great tragedy, but Ed, during the George W. Bush period, there were 13 attacks on various embassies and consulates around the world. Sixty people died. In Karachi, there was a death of one of our diplomats, and those were not investigated during that period of time because it was a tragedy.\"",
      "Readers asked us whether it's true that under Bush, \"there were 13 attacks on various embassies and consulates around the world, (and) 60 people died.\"",
      "We turned to the Global Terrorism Database, a project headquartered at the University of Maryland. The database documents terrorist attacks around the world going back to the 1970s, and experts told us it is the best resource available for this fact-check.",
      "We searched the database for descriptions between January 2001 and January 2009 that included the term \"U.S. embassy.\" We supplemented these with a few other attacks listed in a Huffington Post opinion piece that Garamendi's staff said was their main source for the claim. The Huffington Post column Garamendi cited purposely didn't count any attacks in Baghdad. So we decided to construct our count from scratch.",
      "While Garamendi spoke of \"embassies and consulates,\" we found several U.S. diplomatic targets killed in the line of duty outside official compounds -- such as in convoys or their homes -- and we included them in our count. Once we cross-referenced the attacks in the article and those in the database, we narrowed down the total to 39 attacks or attempted attacks on U.S. embassies and embassy personnel.",
      "Of these 39 attacks, 20 resulted in at least one fatality. (Our complete list is here.) This is higher than Garamendi's claim, though if you only count attacks on embassy and consular property, there were 13.",
      "Garamendi also understated the number of deaths. In the 20 incidents with at least one fatality, the total death toll was 87 -- quite a few more than the 60 Garamendi cited. If you only count those at embassies and consulates proper, the number of deaths drops to 66.",
      "We should note that the vast majority of these deaths were not Americans. We counted 63 deaths that were either of non-Americans or of people whose nationality is unknown. Another three were U.S. civilians. Another 21 were workers at the U.S embassy or consulate, either of American or foreign nationality.",
      "So, using what we think is the most reasonable definition, Garamendi's numbers are a bit low.",
      "What about the implicit comparison he made between Benghazi and these previous attacks? That's a little shakier.",
      "Generally, the experts we contacted agreed that Garamendi was making a reasonable point that there has been a steady, and comparatively overlooked, series of deadly attacks on U.S. embassies in recent years.",
      "Still, these experts also said there are valid reasons to treat Benghazi differently from the earlier attacks.",
      "\"Is Benghazi different? Absolutely,\" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and an adjunct assistant professor in Georgetown University's security studies program.",
      "One reason, he said, is that an American ambassador died in the attack, which hadn't happened since the 1970s. Another relevant question, Gartenstein-Ross said, \"is whether what happened was put to the American people in an honest manner, not just with respect to the administration, but also with respect to the intelligence community.\"",
      "Gartenstein-Ross added that he wasn't endorsing \"how the Republicans go about\" investigating this question. But he did say it's a \"real, legitimate question.\"",
      "\"As always, what causes the problem is not so much what happens, but the response to it,\" said Theodore R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. \" If the administration had come out shortly after the attack and said, Our consulate was attacked by organized Islamist forces, and we will pursue these terrorists and bring them to justice, one way or the other,' I very much doubt there would be much juice in these hearings, if indeed they were being held at all.\"",
      "Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University, agreed that Benghazi brings up important issues.",
      "\"We probably should have had more United States forces on site or at least nearby,\" he said. And the administration had a \"muddled response in terms of releasing information,\" he added.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Garamendi said that \"during the George W. Bush period, there were 13 attacks on various embassies and consulates around the world. Sixty people died.\" There are actually different ways to count the number of attacks, especially when considering attacks on ambassadors and embassy personnel who were traveling to or from embassy property. Overall, we found Garamendi slightly understated the number of deadly attacks and total fatalities, even using a strict definition. Garamendi's claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",

      "To check the accuracy of this pie chart, we had to make a few assumptions. For starters, the chart isn't dated, so we used estimated figures for fiscal year 2015. And since the chart uses some non-standard categories for federal spending, we had to make a few assumptions about which departmental spending should be placed in what category.",
      "That said, we found some fundamental problems with the graphic's calculations and conclusions. To understand them, we'll first provide some background on how federal spending works.",
      "Most federal spending can be categorized as discretionary or mandatory. The levels of discretionary spending are determined through the congressional appropriations process, with both houses of Congress and the president ultimately signing off on an agreed level of spending. Most spending by cabinet departments and independent agencies falls under this category, and it's \"discretionary\" in the sense that if political leaders want to raise, or lower, the amount of spending for a given purpose, they can do so by tinkering with appropriations bills.",
      "The other major category is mandatory spending, which is sometimes referred to as \"entitlements.\" Spending within this category is determined by a formula, and the big pieces are three familiar programs: Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. For each mandatory program, the amount spent is tied directly to the number of people deemed eligible by age or income level. These programs effectively run on autopilot unless Congress changes the formula, making this type of spending more insulated from lawmakers and the president than discretionary spending.",
      "With that background, let's now take a look at how the figures in the pie chart compare to a breakdown of fiscal 2015 discretionary spending (the third column), and to fiscal 2015 total spending (that is, discretionary plus mandatory spending, in the final column).",

      "Recently, activists have shown up at Hillary Clinton's campaign events to urge her to bring back Glass-Steagall.",
      "What is Glass-Steagall?",
      "It's the Depression-era bank regulation that kept different types of financial institutions separate; then-President Bill Clinton signed legislation reversing it in 1999.",
      "Some Glass-Steagall supporters argue that its demise led to the 2007 financial crisis, and some Democrats have put a good amount of effort into restoring it -- such as presidential candidates Martin O'Malley and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.",
      "But Hillary Clinton won't pledge to reinstate Glass-Steagall if she becomes president. And Bill Clinton says criticism over the law's repeal is unfounded.",
      "\"Look at all the grief I got for signing the bill that ended Glass-Steagall,\" Bill Clinton said in an interview with Inc. magazine for its September issue. \"There's not a single, solitary example that it had anything to do with the financial crash.\"",
      "Given the significant attention on Glass-Steagall among Democrats, we wondered if it's true that it didn't have \"anything to do with the financial crash.\"",
      "Our research shows the law's demise was part of a broad deregulatory push that greatly contributed to the financial crisis. But Clinton has a point that a direct line from the 1999 repeal to the market crash in 2007-08 is hard to identify.",
      "Too big to fail",
      "Congress passed Glass-Steagall in 1933, in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash that led to the Great Depression. The law kept commercial banks (where customers deposit money and take out loans) separate from investment firms (which hold securities and make investments) -- more colloquially, the law separated Main Street from Wall Street.",
      "Some experts and lawmakers want to keep these kinds of activities separate, because they're worried that merging them could put the public's money at risk. Here's a simple hypothetical: A bank merges with an investment firm to create a massive company. The investment side makes a huge bet on an investment that fails big time, so the commercial bank side's money -- money individuals have deposited for safe-keeping -- could be at risk. Because those deposits are federally insured, it might require a government bailout. (Think too-big-to-fail.) Supporters of the law say keeping these activities separate prevents this kind of domino effect.",
      "Is this what caused the most recent financial crisis? There's plenty of room for debate here, given that there isn't a single what-caused-the-crisis narrative that every economist accepts. It's safe to say, though, that there is not a prominent group of economists who argue \"but for the 1999 repeal of Glass-Steagall, the crisis would not have happened.\"",
      "Lawrence White, an economist at New York University, doesn't see Glass-Steagall playing any role in the financial crisis whatsoever. He pointed to the crisis' biggest culprits: firms such as Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs and AIG, to name a few. He added that much of the crisis hinged on activity by these institutions that would have been possible with or without Glass-Steagall, such as mass investment in notoriously bad mortgage loans. (Clinton's staff linked us to commentary by several other experts who share White's view.)",
      "We also contacted Barry Ritholtz, a wealth management expert and commentator, who said Glass-Steagall would have done nothing to stop the financial crisis, but not having it made the crisis worse. It encouraged banks to get bigger and to take on riskier investments, so the ripple effects of the crisis were bigger than they would have been otherwise, he said, adding that it wasn't just the headline-making banks that struggled.",
      "The extent over Glass-Steagall's effect on the financial crisis is a topic on which reasonable people can disagree. More so in Clinton's favor is the fact that Glass-Steagall was a shadow of its former self by the time 1999 rolled around.",
      "Deregulating like it's 1999",
      "A few decades out from the Depression, starting in earnest in the 1970s, there was a push to roll back financial regulations that continued throughout the administrations of former presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. As part of that movement, banks and lawmakers steadily chipped away at Glass-Steagall and took advantage of loopholes. Banks were engaging in the kinds of activity Glass-Steagall was intended to stop even though the law was still on the books.",
      "By the time Clinton signed the Financial Services Modernization Act, commonly known as Gramm-Leach-Bliley, repealing the key components of Glass-Steagall in 1999, the regulation was nearly toothless. The law was simply catching up to what the market had already accomplished in the previous 10 to 15 years, said Kathleen Day, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University and an expert in financial crises.",
      "Take for example the poster child of the end of Glass-Steagall: The merger of Citicorp, a bank, and Travelers Group, a financial conglomerate, was announced in 1998 before Glass-Steagall was repealed. Even though this was the exact type of merger Glass-Steagall was intended to halt, the financial industry did not see many obstacles for the creation of Citigroup.",
      "\"Citigroup and others wanted and got the repeal of Glass-Steagall in order to validate what they had already been allowed to do,\" said Simon Johnson, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "So the overall, decades-in-the-making decline of Glass-Steagall might have contributed to the financial crisis and its fallout, as it was part of the deregulatory push. But Clinton putting pen-to-paper on the repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999 probably didn't make any meaningful difference.",
      "But Clinton's hands aren't clean of the financial crisis, because his administration played no small part in the longer term deregulatory trend. Clinton and his administration did not make an earnest attempt to maintain oversight over the big, hybrid banks created by the demise of Glass-Steagall, Day said. Additionally, the administration's firm decision not to regulate other aspects of the financial market played a meaningful role in the crisis -- for example, the absence of regulations regarding over-the-counter derivatives, which were becoming increasingly prevalent, despite internal warnings.",
      "Clinton's claim \"might be technically true, but it's a sin of omission,\" Day said.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Clinton said, \"There's not a single, solitary example that\" signing the bill to end Glass-Steagall \"had anything to do with the financial crash.\"",
      "By focusing on the bill that officially repealed Glass-Steagall, Clinton's statement ignores the fact that the demise of Glass-Steagall took place over decades, amid a deregulatory push in which the Clinton administration played a role. By the time the law to repeal hit his desk, Glass-Steagall had been whittled down so much that it wasn't very meaningful. It's a matter of debate how much of a role the overall demise of Glass-Steagall had in causing the financial crisis, but we couldn't find any economists who argue that the regulation was the sole linchpin keeping the financial system stable until its official repeal in 1999. Overall, we rate Clinton's claim Mostly True."

From the intelligence community's perspective, as I said, I think we've developed an effective way to touch all of our databases and resources to figure out what we know about individuals.

The bad news is, there is no risk-free process.\"",
      "A day later, on Oct. 22, Comey repeated his comments before the House Judiciary Committee: \"We have gotten much better as an intelligence community at joining our efforts and checking our databases in a way that gives us high confidence. If we have a record on somebody, it will surface. That's the good news. The challenge we face with Syria is that we don't have that rich set of data. So even though we've gotten better at querying what we have, we certainly will have less overall.

Yes, we could get rid of (former Libyan dictator Muammar) Gaddafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS. Yes, we could get rid of (Syrian dictator Bashar) Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.

      "The resolution called for peaceful regime change, saying Gaddafi should \"desist from further violence, recognize the Libyan people's demand for democratic change, resign his position and permit a peaceful transition to democracy.\"",
      "A Senate resolution carries very little weight. It has no legal teeth and is more like a statement expressing the general \"sense of Congress,\" said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University.",

      "\"Look, everybody understands Gaddafi is a thug and murderer,\" Sanders said to Fox News. \"We want to see him go, but I think in the midst of two wars (in Iraq and Afghanistan), I'm not quite sure we need a third war, and I hope the president tells us that our troops will be leaving there, that our military action in Libya will be ending very, very shortly.\"",

Neither resolution explicitly call for regime change, though.",

      "\"I think we're facing enormous challenges in this country. The Obama economy has led to the lowest labor force participation since 1978. Ninety-two million Americans aren't working. Obamacare is a train wreck. We're seeing our constitutional rights under assault. And abroad the Obama-Clinton-Kerry foreign policy is an unmitigated disaster. Leading from behind doesn't work.",
      "We've previously checked a claim by Cruz that \"we've got the lowest labor force participation in over three decades, since 1978.\" We rated that Mostly True at the time, and it's still an accurate claim today. But we wondered whether Cruz was right that \"92 million Americans aren't working.\" So we took a closer look.",
      "In one sense, Cruz's estimate is actually too low. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 249.7 million non-institutionalized civilians 16 years of age and older last month. Of those, 148.2 million were employed, leaving 101.7 million not employed.",
      "But neither Cruz's 92 million figure nor the actual 101.7 million figure is especially meaningful -- because they lump in both the young and the old.",
      "Of the 101.7 million people who are not employed, 37.5 million are age 65 and over -- an age when Medicare kicks in and many Americans head into retirement. Another 11.9 million are between 16 and 19, meaning they're either high-school-age or starting college. And another 8 million are age 20 to 24, when many are in college or graduate school.",
      "Combined, these groups account for 57.5 million Americans -- or more than three-fifths of the number Cruz cited.",
      "Could one quibble with our calculation? Sure -- one could exclude the 20 to 24 category since not everyone that age is college-bound. And improving senior health means that Americans can effectively work past 65.",
      "Still, we don't see much justification for Cruz counting high-school-age kids (roughly 10 million) and Americans 75 and up (17.6 million). Even this far more restrictive definition leaves almost one-third of Cruz's number questionable.",
      "Another point worth noting: Just because someone in the prime working-age range (25 to 64) isn't working doesn't mean that they are unemployed. They may be disabled, taking care of children full-time or have gone back to school. The actual number of officially unemployed Americans in January was a little under 9 million -- just one-tenth of the figure Cruz cited as \"not working.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Cruz said that \"92 million Americans aren't working.\" Once you strip out senior citizens and school-age Americans, the number is less than half that. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",
      "UPDATED, Feb. 11, 2015: After this fact-check was published, Cruz's office got back to PolitiFact with sourcing for the statistic. The statistic, they said, came from the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- Table A-1, for the total civilian, non-institutionalized population not in labor force, seasonally adjusted, for January 2015. The total for that month was 92.5 million. Spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said that Cruz was \"relying on objective federal labor statistics\" in making his statement. However, our fact-check didn't question the veracity of the BLS statistics only their relevance to Cruz's point. We continue to believe the statistic includes Americans too young and too old to be expected to work, and we stand by our rating of Mostly False."

      "This is not the first time a similar claim has popped onto our radar screen.",
      "In December 2012, PolitiFact Texas rated False a claim made two days after the Newtown elementary school shooting. When U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, appeared on Fox News Sunday, he was asked why he believed ordinary Americans should be able to buy semi-automatic weapons designed for military use.

      "\"The idea of resistance to tyranny being dependent on a nation of gun-wielding individuals acting at their own behest or even on local initiative would have been anathema to Washington,\" Lengel told PolitiFact Texas. \"Indeed, during the (Revolutionary) war he very frequently lamented the crimes carried out by armed civilians or undisciplined militia against their unarmed neighbors. The solution to these crimes, as he understood it, was to increase the power of the government and the army to prevent and punish them -- not to put more guns in the hands of civilians.\"",
      "Indeed, during the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794, \"citizens of Western Pennsylvania rose up to fight a new tax on the whiskey they produced,\" said Mary Thompson, research historian at Washington's Virginia home, Mount Vernon.

      "A group founded by Karl Rove launched one of the first salvos of the 2016 presidential election cycle with a Web video attacking presumed Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton.",
      "American Crossroads released a video Feb. 23 that features audio of a speech from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat from the party's progressive wing, warning that \"powerful interests have tried to capture Washington and rig the system in their favor.\" The video shows photos of Clinton meeting with various foreign delegates and leaders.",
      "Text on the screen alleges that \"the Clintons' foundation took millions from foreign governments\" including \"up to $5 million\" from the United Arab Emirates and \"up to $25 million\" from Saudi Arabia.",
      "We should note off the bat that Warren's remarks were ripped from two separate speeches aimed at limiting money from corporations and Super PACs in politics, and they were merged together and cut in such a way to eliminate those references. They certainly weren't about Clinton or foundations or foreign governments.",
      "Still, we wanted to check whether Bill and Hillary Clinton's foundation has indeed received large sums of money from foreign governments.",
      "Former President Bill Clinton started the William J. Clinton Foundation in 2001 as a nonprofit philanthropy for global development. The organization partners with government, non-government organizations and businesses to tackle quality-of-life issues, such as AIDS, poverty and climate change.",
      "When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009, the foundation agreed to disclose its donors at the request of the White House. According to a memorandum of understanding, the foundation could continue to collect donations from countries with which it had existing relationships or running grant programs. If contributions from those countries increased significantly or a new foreign government wanted to make a donation, the State Department would have to first approve (more on that in a bit).",
      "We should emphasize there is nothing illegal about the contributions. Candidates for office are prohibited by law from accepting campaign contributions from foreign governments, but foundations have no such restriction. The main issue is that the foundation presented ethical quandaries when Clinton was a candidate for president in 2008 and when she was Secretary of State. But at this time, the foundation was her husband's project, not hers.",
      "That changed when Clinton left the State Department. In 2013, the foundation became the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton foundation, with Hillary Clinton taking an active role in fundraising.",
      "Throughout the years, donors have included celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz, businesses like eBay and Pepsi, and other nonprofits, like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. And, yes, some governments.",
      "So which countries and foreign governments have donated to her organization? Not just Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, it turns out.",
      "We pulled the information from the Clinton Foundation website, which tracks donors by contribution range. As it is, we don't have exact amount for each donation, nor do we know when the contribution was made except donations made in 2014, which were marked on the site.",
      "Here's what we found. Due to search constraints on the Clinton Foundation's website and the vast number of small donations, we're only including contributions larger than $25,000.",

      "So the assertion at the center of the ad is accurate: the Clinton Foundation did, in fact, take millions from foreign governments. Additionally, the ad singled out two countries the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia that have donated to the foundation since Hillary Clinton officially joined her family's foundation.",
      "Clinton Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian said most of the money from foreign countries is earmarked for specific projects and grants, like AIDS relief. Minassian said that the ad implied nefarious dealings, and that isn't the case.",
      "\"I just have a problem with the premise of the ad,\" Minassian said. \"It's the same premise when people say we're the same as a Super PAC. We're not; we're philanthropy. This is what NGOs do.\"",
      "Readers can decide for themselves how they feel about the charge. We're just checking the fact behind the ad. American Crossroads did not respond to a voicemail and emails.",
      "We should note that since the ad came out, and while we were reporting this story, the Washington Post reported that the contribution from Algeria, that had never donated previously, came while Clinton was Secretary of State and was not approved by the State Department.",
      "Minassian said the donation from Algeria was related to Haiti relief efforts, and that, per the agreement with the White House, \"the State Department should have been formally informed.\"",
      "\"As the Clinton Foundation did with all donations it received for earthquake relief, the entire amount of Algeria's contribution was distributed as aid in Haiti,\" Minassian said. \"This was a one-time, specific donation to help Haiti and Algeria had not donated to the Clinton Foundation before and has not since.\"",

      "As we noted, it doesn't violate campaign rules for a nonprofit philanthropy to accept donations from foreign governments. Over the years, the Clinton Foundation has taken millions of dollars from foreign governments. This includes between $1 million and $5 million from the United Arab Emirates and between $10 million and $25 million from Saudi Arabia. At least a portion of those donations came in 2014, after Clinton left the State Department and formally joined the family's foundation that had previously been in her husband's name alone.",

      "Oh, and slicing up the deficit. Obama is super-pumped about that. He made a point to brag about the deficit's drop in his 2015 State of the Union address.",
      "\"At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits,\" Obama said. \"Instead, we've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years.\"",
      "Is he right about the deficit dropping by two-thirds?",
      "What the White House says",
      "As a reminder, don't get the deficit twisted with the debt. They are only related, not the same.",
      "The country's annual deficit is the difference between what the government collects in revenues and spends in one year. The national debt, which exceeds $18 trillion, is the net of annual deficits minus any annual surpluses.",
      "To back up his claim, Obama is comparing his first budget year in office -- 2009 -- to 2014.",
      "The White House is breaking down the deficit as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, and not actual dollars. Economists told us this is a valid way of analyzing the deficit, because it factors in the economy's change over time. The White House sent us this chart, which relies on data from the White House Office of Management and Budget.",
      "",
      "In fiscal year 2009, which started almost four months before Obama's presidency began and ended eight months into it, the deficit was 9.8 percent of GDP. The 2014 shortfall is 2.8 percent of GDP -- a decrease of 71 percent. So that's where the claim comes from.",
      "The situation largely tracks if you use real dollars. Using the same comparison with Congressional Budget Office figures, the deficit fell from $1.4 trillion in the 2009 fiscal year to $486 billion in the 2014 fiscal year -- a drop of about 66 percent.",
      "Why the drop might not be so exciting",
      "Experts told us that while Obama's math may be correct, it's missing some important caveats.",
      "First, it's important to note that the deficit swelled in 2009 (hence the steady drop). In 2008, the deficit was $458 billion, or 3.1 percent of GDP. Those deficits are smaller than the ones the country is facing today. The 2009 fiscal year represented a huge jump in the deficit, partly because of the massive stimulus program to jumpstart the cratering economy.",
      "\"This is not to say that that large deficit was his fault, but if one used the 2008 deficit as a frame of reference, the comparison would be quite different,\" said Alan Auerbach, University of California Berkeley professor of economics and law.",
      "Also, some economists we consulted pointed out that the 2009 fiscal year was Obama's first year in office, and so not necessarily a good starting point since he had little control over the spending in that year.",
      "And there's another issue. Princeton University economics professor Harvey Rosen said the more important question is if Obama has put the government on a path that will keep deficits stable. \"And the answer is no,\" Rosen said, because entitlement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, have not had substantial reform.",
      "The long-term forecast for the deficit illustrates this point.",
      "Absent substantial reform, the Congressional Budget Office expects a few more years of short-term deficit decreases followed by bigger shortfalls in 10 and 20 years. Federal spending is projected to increase through 2039, so much so that by then the federal debt held by the public will reach a point only seen after World War II.",
      "The deficit would be equal to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2029 and 6.5 percent of GDP by 2039, a higher deficit than any year between 1947 and 2008.",
      "This chart from the Congressional Budget Office shows how the deficit is not expected to continue its downward trend in recent years.",
      "",
      "A final word on Obama's point from the experts.",
      "The deficit has come down in recent years because of the strengthening economy, which drives tax revenues up, and the draw-down of various economic stimulus programs that were implemented to weather the financial crisis. Additionally, the expiration of 2 percent payroll tax cuts and increases in tax rates for high-income earners played a role, albeit a smaller one.",
      "\"It's not clear one would want to view the evolution as relating to fiscal responsibility rather than an improving economy,\" Auerbach said.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Obama said since taking office the country has seen \"our deficits cut by two-thirds.\"",
      "His claim is accurate if you use 2009, his first year in office with an historically high deficit, as a starting point.",
      "The claim ignores a stark reality about the deficits, however. The country's spending is not expected to continue its downward route, according to federal forecasters, for factors that include increased interest payments on the debt and the lack of substantial policy changes for the country's biggest programs, like Social Security and Medicare.",
      "The deficits have largely come down as a result of the improved economy for which Obama cannot assume full credit.",

      "As hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders grows, political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting the socialist Vermont senator is a gun nut.",
      "\"One issue your Democratic rivals are starting to hit you with is the fact that you have, in the past, sided with the NRA on some gun issues,\" CNN's Jake Tapper said in a July 5 interview with Sanders, alluding to an attack ad paid for by a pro-Martin O'Malley group.",
      "\"Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods,\" said the attack, which first aired June 25. \"Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns.\"",
      "Sanders' record on guns has been the subject of liberal ire (\"Bernie Sanders, gun nut\") as well as conservative glee (\"Sorry liberals, Bernie Sanders is a gun nut\"). So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation.",
      "The Brady Act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks. (After 1998, the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the checks.)",
      "But before Brady became law, it underwent many transformations. Sanders, elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, voted on it numerous times, virtually almost always in opposition:",
      "In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House.",
      "The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House. In Nov. 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didn't muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992.",
      "After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn't exist at the time).",
      "He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why.",
      "The final compromise version of the Brady bill -- an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it.",
      "According to Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver, Sanders' reason for opposing the Brady bill was two-fold. First, he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach. And second, he was doing his job.",
      "\"He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,\" Weaver said. \"He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont.\"",
      "In April 1991, Sanders' then-chief of staff Anthony Pollina echoed the idea that Sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents.",
      "\"Bernie's response is that he doesn't just represent liberals and progressives. He was sent to Washington to present all of Vermont,\" Pollina said. \"It's not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority position, particularly on something Vermonters have been very clear about.\"",
      "The Green Mountain State, though left-leaning, has a high gun ownership rate and lax gun control laws (as well as a low homicide rate). That and Sanders' own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record, experts told us.",
      "\"As a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners, Vermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues, historically,\" explained Bertram Johnson, a professor of political science at Middlebury College in Vermont. \"He seems to support more regulation of guns than the U.S. presently has, but he recognizes his constituents' preferences so does not make gun control a priority.\"",
      "\"I think he has disappointed many progressives in Vermont with his gun positions, which sort of walk a middle line and angering both sides through the years,\" said Chris Graff, the former Vermont Associated Press bureau chief. \"Gun control is a tough issue in Vermont for all politicians.\"",
      "Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, whose 2004 presidential bid is often compared to Sanders' 2016 run, received high marks from the National Rifle Association. Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy also voted against the Brady bill. For his part, Sanders has voted to tighten gun control about half the time, and to protect Second Amendment rights the other half.",

      "During a campaign event in Portland, Maine, that attracted thousands of supporters, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders made a striking claim about unemployment among African-American youth.",
      "\"For young people who have graduated high school or dropped out of high school, who are between the ages of 17 and 20, if they happen to be white, the unemployment rate is 33 percent,\" he said. \"If they are Hispanic, the unemployment rate is 36 percent. If they are African-American, the real unemployment rate for young people is 51 percent.\"",
      "A reader asked us to check whether Sanders was correct, so we took a closer look. (Sanders seems to have made this a go-to talking point in his campaign; he offered a similar claim in an interview with The Nation.)",
      "We'll start by noting that the most commonly used unemployment-rate statistic is not as high for each group as Sanders indicated. The most readily available data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics covers the age range from 16 to 19, which isn't identical but gives a quick approximation.",
      "For whites in that age range, the official unemployment rate was 15.7 percent, for Hispanics it was 20.8 percent and for African-Americans it was 31.8 percent.",
      "In other words, the official unemployment rate shows the same general pattern -- that African-American youth unemployment is significantly higher than white youth unemployment and, to a lesser extent, higher than Hispanic youth unemployment. Still, the levels for each group are lower than what Sanders said.",
      "So what's going on?",
      "Sanders' camp pointed us to research by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank. This data is different from the more familiar measurements for a few reasons.",
      "One, the institute didn't just look at employment status for people between the ages of 17 and 20; it limited its reach to high school graduates who were not enrolled in further schooling.",
      "And two, EPI counted not only unemployed workers but also those who were working part-time due to the weakness of the economy and those who were \"marginally attached to the labor force.\" The latter category includes people who did not meet the strict definition of being in the job market, but weren't entirely out of the market, either.",
      "The statistic EPI used, known by the wonky shorthand U-6, is officially called a measure of \"labor underutilization\" rather than \"unemployment.\" EPI itself used the term \"underemployment\" in its research.",
      "It's a real statistic, but Sanders didn't really describe it the correct way. He twice used the term \"unemployment rate\" and once used the variation \"real unemployment rate,\" a vague term that doesn't have any official definition at BLS and wasn't mentioned in the EPI research he was quoting.",
      "On the other hand, Sanders' choice of statistics actually understated his broader point. Since it's reasonable to assume that dropouts have an even higher unemployment rate than high-school graduates, the figure for \"young people who have graduated high school or dropped out of high school,\" as he put it, is probably even higher than 51 percent, since that figure includes only high school graduates.",
      "All in all, economists agreed that Sanders had a point despite his problems with terminology.",
      "\"He should have been clearer,\" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. \"But I think the overall scale is right. Both education and race are predictive of employment outcomes in the United States. A number of different studies show that even for the same levels of education, minorities appear to have worse average employment outcomes.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Sanders said that for African-Americans between the ages of 17 and 20, \"the real unemployment rate is 51 percent.\" His terminology was off, but the numbers he used check out, and his general point was correct -- that in an apples-to-apples comparison, African-American youth have significantly worse prospects in the job market than either Hispanics or whites do. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True."

The outcome of the decision, expected in June, could mean either that same-sex marriage will become legal in all states or that some states will institute new bans on same-sex marriage.

      "December 1999: Clinton told a group of gay contributors at a fundraiser that she was against the \"don't ask, don't tell\" military policy signed by her husband.",
      "The New York Times reported that Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said she supported the Defense of Marriage Act but added that \"same-sex unions should be recognized and that same-sex unions should be entitled to all the rights and privileges that every other American gets.\"",
      "January 2000: At a news conference in White Plains, Clinton said, \"Marriage has got historic, religious and moral content that goes back to the beginning of time, and I think a marriage is as a marriage has always been, between a man and a woman. But I also believe that people in committed gay marriages, as they believe them to be, should be given rights under the law that recognize and respect their relationship.\"",
      "April 2000: Clinton again expressed support for civil unions. \"I have supported the kind of rights and responsibilities that are being extended to gay couples in Vermont,\" she said.",
      "July 2004: Clinton spoke on the Senate floor against a proposed federal amendment to ban same-sex marriage. (The amendment ultimately failed.) Though she opposed it, she said that she believed that marriage was \"a sacred bond between a man and a woman.\"",
      "However, she said she took \"umbrage at anyone who might suggest that those of us who worry about amending the Constitution are less committed to the sanctity of marriage, or to the fundamental bedrock principle that exists between a man and a woman.\"",
      "October 2006: Clinton told a group of gay elected officials that she would support same-sex marriage in New York if a future governor and Legislature chose to enact such a law.",
      "\"I support states making the decision,\" she said.",
      "As a 2008 presidential candidate",
      "In 2007, all the presidential contenders except for longshot candidates -- both Democrats and GOP -- were against same-sex marriage, the New York Times reported. So were the majority of Americans, polls showed.",
      "May 2007: In a questionnaire for the Human Rights Campaign in 2007, Clinton backed away from the Defense of Marriage Act:",
      "\"I support repealing the provision of DOMA that may prohibit the federal government from providing benefits to people in states that recognize same-sex marriage.\"",
      "In response to a question about whether marriage should be made legally available to two committed adults of the same sex, Clinton marked that she was \"opposed\" though she stated she supported civil unions.",
      "August 2007: In a Democratic primary debate sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign and LOGO Network (a gay-oriented TV station) Clinton was asked \"What is at the heart of your opposition to same-sex marriage?\"",
      "Clinton replied: \"Well, I prefer to think of it as being very positive about civil unions. You know, it's a personal position. How we get to full equality is the debate we're having, and I am absolutely in favor of civil unions with full equality of benefits, rights, and privileges.\"",
      "As a 2016 presidential candidate",
      "As Clinton got ready for her second presidential bid, she again modified her position.",
      "March 2013: After leaving her position as secretary of state, she announced her support for same-sex marriage in a video with the Human Rights Campaign on March 18, 2013.",
      "\"LGBT Americans are our colleagues, our teachers, our soldiers, our friends, our loved ones. And they are full and equal citizens, and they deserve the rights of citizenship. That includes marriage. That's why I support marriage for lesbian and gay couples. I support it personally and as a matter of policy and law, embedded in a broader effort to advance equality and opportunity for LGBT Americans and all Americans.\"",
      "The comments put her in line with other Democrats at the time who were mentioned as potential 2016 presidential contenders, including Vice President Joe Biden, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. Obama had announced his support for same-sex marriage in May 2012.",
      "June 2013: Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton issued a joint statement about the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning the Defense of Marriage Act. The congratulatory note didn't mention that Bill Clinton had signed the law back in 1996: \"the Court recognized that discrimination towards any group holds us all back in our efforts to form a more perfect union.\"",
      "June 2014: NPR's Terry Gross grilled Clinton about her past positions' on gay marriage in what led to a testy exchange. Gross tried to get Clinton to explain if she had truly changed her stance or if the shifting political landscape made it possible for her to announce her support.",
      "At one point Gross asked, \"Would you say your view evolved since the '90s or that the American public evolved, allowing you to state your real view?\"",
      "Clinton replied: \"I think I'm an American. (Laughing) And I think we have all evolved, and it's been one of the fastest, most sweeping transformations.\"",
      "April 2015: On the day of the Supreme Court hearing oral arguments about same-sex marriage bans in a handful of states in April, Clinton changed her \"H\" logo to rainbow-colored and tweeted a message of support: \"Every loving couple & family deserves to be recognized & treated equally under the law across our nation. #LoveMustWin #LoveCantWait.\"",
      "Our conclusion",
      "Clinton opposed same-sex marriage as a candidate for the Senate, while in office as a senator, and while running for president in 2008. She expressed her support for civil unions starting in 2000 and for the rights' of states to set their own laws in favor of same-sex marriage in 2006.",
      "As polls showed that a majority of Americans supported same-sex marriage, Clinton's views changed, too. She announced her support for same-sex marriage in March 2013.",
      "It's up to voters to decide how they feel about her changed stance, but on same-sex marriage we give Clinton a Full Flop."

      "In the space of a few days, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. -- who only won his office four months ago -- became a central player in the drama over a potential nuclear deal with Iran.",
      "Cotton spearheaded a letter to Iran's leaders that was ultimately signed by 47 Republican senators saying that Congress could ultimately overrule any agreement. Democrats said the letter undermined presidential authority to carry out foreign policy.",
      "On March 9, 2015, shortly after news of the letter broke, Cotton appeared on Fox News Channel and said this:",
      "\"We don't know what the final terms of the deal are. But we know so far that Susan Rice, the president's national security adviser, has already conceded that Iran will have a robust uranium enrichment capability. The president has said this bill will have a sunset, perhaps as little as 10 years (from now). Those two terms alone make this deal unacceptable.\"",
      "We see two related but distinct questions here. The first one is easier: Did Rice literally say what Cotton said she did? The second is trickier: Is what Rice said functionally equivalent to what Cotton claimed?",
      "Outline of the negotiations",
      "First, some background on the Iran nuclear negotiations.",
      "In November 2013, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany, known as the P5+1, joined with Iran in signing an agreement that temporarily stopped Iran's production of potentially weapons-grade nuclear material. In 2014, that agreement was extended, with continued sanctions relief, including the ability to sell oil and to gain access to assets frozen in overseas bank accounts, and some additional nuclear steps by Iran. This interim agreement expires in June.",
      "Under the interim deal, Iran was cleared to continue enriching uranium, though only to the diluted level of 5 percent and with its stockpile capped. That falls well short of what weapon makers would need to create a bomb.",
      "On the other hand, critics of the deal say the first 5 percent enrichment is the toughest, meaning it would be comparatively easy for Iran to reach 90 percent once it got to 5 percent. Still, supporters of the administration's approach counter that it would take Iran roughly a year to make a bomb, leaving time for the world to detect what's happening and respond.",
      "Rice's speech to AIPAC",
      "Cotton's office didn't return two inquiries, but we found a quote by Rice that seems to be the one Cotton is referencing; it attracted attention in both the conservative and mainstream media.",
      "Rice made the remarks in a March 2 speech to a convention of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, an influential pro-Israel group that includes many skeptics of President Barack Obama's approach:",
      "\"We cannot let a totally unachievable ideal stand in the way of a good deal. I know that some of you will be urging Congress to insist that Iran forego its domestic enrichment capacity entirely. But, as desirable as that would be, it is neither realistic nor achievable. Even our closest international partners in the P5+1 (the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China and Germany) do not support denying Iran the ability ever to pursue peaceful nuclear energy. If that is our goal, our partners will abandon us, undermining the sanctions we have imposed so effectively together. Simply put, that is not a viable negotiating position. Nor is it even attainable. The plain fact is, no one can make Iran unlearn the scientific and nuclear expertise it already possesses.\"",
      "This makes it clear that Rice didn't use the word \"robust.\"",
      "Two arms-control experts agreed that Cotton was taking liberties with Rice's words.",
      "\"I think Cotton exaggerated what Rice said,\" said Richard Nephew, the program director for economic statecraft, sanctions and energy markets at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. \" 'Robust' has a connotation that, to me, means more than just a capability. I use the term robust' to mean healthy' or strong.' What exactly that means probably depends on the eye of the beholder, but to me, robust' evokes some real weight, which isn't what Rice said.\"",
      "Matthew Bunn, an arms-control specialist at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, agreed that Cotton was \"clearly incorrect\" in how he quoted Rice.",
      "\"If this is the quote Cotton was referring to, he's simply wrong about what she said. She said they won't have zero, not that they will have a robust' capability,\" Bunn said.",
      "The White House told PolitiFact that Cotton embellished Rice's words. \"Our goal is to effectively shut down the four pathways to fissile material for a nuclear weapon: uranium enrichment at Natanz; uranium enrichment at Fordow; the plutonium pathway; and the possibility of a covert pathway,\" said National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan. \"We seek to do this by extending Iran's breakout time to at least one year which is significantly longer than what experts have publicly estimated is Iran's current breakout time of approximately two to three months.\"",
      "Was Cotton's implication reasonable?",
      "Rice argued in her speech that it's unrealistic to expect diplomacy to reduce Iran's enrichment capability to zero. But do nuclear experts believe that any amount of enrichment capability greater than zero is inherently \"robust\"? Or is there a sweet spot between \"zero\" and \"robust\" in which Iran's potential nuclear-bomb ambitions would be weakened to the point of inefficacy?",
      "The experts we checked with said there probably is such a sweet spot, but they cautioned that it's hard to know for sure.",
      "Nephew and Bunn said the enrichment capabilities currently envisioned would, combined with the restrictions and monitoring established under the agreement, leave Iran with about a year's work to make material for a bomb at its inspected facilities. That, Bunn argued, would give the world time to notice what's going on and respond, and \"would effectively take that option off the table for Iran.\"",
      "A greater risk, Bunn said, is that if Iran decides to go full-steam ahead on building a bomb, \"it is far more likely to build a secret site for that purpose, rather than trying to do it with the world knowing what they are doing at facilities that could readily be bombed.\"",
      "To be sure, that's a worrisome scenario -- but it's also one that doesn't depend on how much enrichment capability is allowed under the deal currently being negotiated.",
      "Ultimately, there are too many unknowns to say with any certainty how \"robust\" Iran's enrichment capability would be -- starting with the fact that the negotiations are still ongoing, said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security.",
      "\"The meaning of robust' is in the eye of the beholder,\" Albright said. \"But knowing for sure who is right depends on knowing how much nuclear infrastructure will remain and what are the limits on its operation. We cannot know that for sure until we see a deal.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Cotton said, \"Susan Rice, the president's national security adviser, has already conceded that Iran will have a robust uranium enrichment capability.\"",
      "Cotton essentially puts words in Rice's mouth when he says she \"conceded\" that Iran will keep a \"robust\" enrichment capability. She didn't use those words in the AIPAC speech.",
      "Meanwhile, what she did say -- that zero enrichment capability, \"as desirable as that would be, it is neither realistic nor achievable\" -- may or may not lead to Cotton's conclusion that Iran will be left with a \"robust\" capability. Experts expect that there is a point between \"zero\" and \"robust\" where Iran's nuclear ambitions are hampered, but there are too many variables and too much uncertainty to say so with certainty. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.",

      "Donald Trump likes to talk about how China takes advantage of the United States economy, so it wasn't surprising to see him bring up the People's Republic at the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee.",
      "When asked a question about the recently released Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, Trump took to bashing China.",
      "\"The TPP is horrible deal,\" Trump said. \"It's a deal that was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone.\"",
      "\"If you look at the way China and India and almost everybody takes advantage of the United States -- China in particular, because they're so good. It's the No. 1 abuser of this country,\" Trump said. \"And if you look at the way they take advantage, it's through currency manipulation. It's not even discussed in the almost 6,000-page agreement.\"",
      "There's just one problem with Trump's rant on China, as Sen. Rand Paul emphatically pointed out at the debate: China isn't actually a part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.",
      "To give Trump the benefit of the doubt, we asked some experts if there is any way China could benefit \"through the back door\" from the TPP. The short answer: no.",
      "An overview of the TPP",
      "While you could read the entire trade deal in full, as Trump correctly points out, it's more than 6,000 pages long. Here's a quick summary, and you can check out a more detailed guide on Vox:",
      "The TPP involves 12 countries: the United States, Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and Brunei Darussalam.",
      "The deal is meant to reduce trade barriers between these countries by lowering tariffs on goods, coordinating regulations and more.",
      "The deal could also \"provide stronger legal protections to drug companies, lengthen the term of copyright protection, give foreign investors a new way to challenge countries' laws and regulations, and much more,\" according to Vox.",
      "In June, Congress authorized \"fast-track\" authority for President Obama, meaning Congress will promptly approve or disapprove the agreement Obama has negotiated -- there will be no amendments or filibusters. A vote is expected in 2016.",
      "The deal was negotiated in secret before being released to the public.",
      "Again, we should make it clear: China was in no way involved in TPP negotiations.",
      "Can China somehow benefit?",
      "We asked experts if there was any way China could possibly take advantage of the TPP. The experts all agreed: The trade deal will most likely negatively impact China.",
      "Joel P. Trachtman, an international law professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, said the deal \"would mean there would be zero tariffs on goods coming to the United States from places that compete with China.\" \"It certainly wouldn't be expected to help China,\" he said.",
      "The only way China might benefit, Trachtman said, is if it has investments in any of the countries involved in the deal. For example, if China has invested in plants in Vietnam, they might become more valuable to China; however, the benefits of those investments would be \"small and rather insignificant.\"",
      "Daniel Pearson, a senior fellow in trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, said Trump's assertion that China continuously manipulates its currency is completely off-base.",
      "\"Some people are all wrapped up in this issue of currency manipulation. I don't think that's applicable to the Chinese,\" Pearson said. \"It was never clear to me that China artificially lowered the value of its currency to gain an export advantage (in the past).\"",
      "We should also note that the TPP actually does mention currency manipulation. A side agreement in the trade deal -- separate from the 6,000 page main text -- says the 12 countries involved agree not to artificially deflate the value of their currencies. However, there is no enforceability provision -- meaning the clause is more of an honor code than a strict regulation.",
      "\"There aren't many economists who would be comfortable with an enforceable currency manipulation clause,\" says Emily J. Blanchard, an associate professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. \"A binding currency provision would tie policy makers' hands at precisely the wrong time: when a central bank-- like the U.S. Federal Reserve-- needs to respond to a downturn in the local economy.\"",
      "The only way China could benefit from the TPP, Pearson said, is if it experiences the \"spillover benefits\" of increased trading between the 12 countries involved in the TPP.",
      "\"There is some possibility that there will be trade diversion away from China and more trade between other TPP member countries,\" Pearson said. \"That's a potential negative. However, that may be entirely offset by the greater level of economic activity that we should expect to see in the TPP member countries.\"",
      "Blanchard said she finds it \"highly implausible\" that China would benefit from the TPP. If it does, as Pearson suggests, so would the rest of the countries involved in the agreement.",
      "\"TPP is going to encourage greater trade integration among its signatories in Southeast Asia and beyond,\" she said. \"That will inevitably suck some of the oxygen out of China's local economy, as supply chains reorient toward other TPP countries, including the U.S.\"",
      "To Trump's assertion that the trade deal was designed for China's benefit, experts say it's actually the opposite. While Blanchard said experts are reluctant to suggest the agreement is a way of taking a shot at China, the TPP does allow the United States to shape trade practices in the Pacific before China can.",
      "\"If TPP passes, its enforceable labor and environmental provisions, curbs on state-owned enterprises, strong (intellectual property) laws, and transparency requirements will redefine the rules of the road in global trade agreements,\" she said. \"This is definitely not the same rulebook that China would have written.\"",
      "All three experts agreed that China could try and join the TPP in the future, but it first has to meet the requirements laid out in the agreement -- something we shouldn't expect to happen any time soon.",
      "China joining the TPP \"would require further evolution of the Chinese economy to be more open and transparent,\" Pearson said. \"It would definitely be good for the Chinese once they are able to join, but frankly, that would also be good for the United States.\"",
      "In the days after the debate, Trump was asked if he knew that China was not part of the trade deal. Trump said he did and repeated his claim that China could benefit. But he still didn't explain how that would actually work.",
      "\"Well, I know that China is not in the deal,\" Trump said. \"And if they look at speeches they will see I talk about it all the time, this deal is going to be a great deal for China. It is going to be unbelievable because China is going to come in through the backdoor, and that is what I said. They are going to come in later through the backdoor and they will take advantage of what all of these other people were negotiating, and the Wall Street Journal does a big editorial that I didn't know about China.\"",

There's a chance that China could join the TPP down the line, but not without robust changes to its economy.

And yet, we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be?\"",
      "Obama's underlying point was to highlight the lack of resources and legislative action taken on gun violence. Some have questioned the merit of such a comparison -- for example, critics have pointed out that cigarettes kill more people than guns. We're not weighing in on that debate. Rather, we're looking just at the data.",
      "Multiple outlets obliged (though each came up with slightly different numbers). Several readers asked us to check out one specific comparison widely shared on Facebook and Twitter. It was created by NowThis, a New York-based news company that produces content specifically for social media.",
      "The image says that 24 Americans have been killed by terrorism in the last decade, while 280,024 Americans were killed by guns.",
      "While NowThis' numbers aren't perfect, the overarching point is accurate. There have been far more deaths from gun violence than from terrorist attacks.",
      "Walking through the math",
      "Let's start with the tally for terrorist-related deaths. NowThis senior editorial producer Versha Sharma told PolitiFact that the 24 figure refers to the number of U.S. citizens killed by terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, and does not include deaths abroad.",
      "Sharma acknowledged that this could have been made clear in the graphic. But she maintained that it's more apt to compare domestic gun deaths to domestic terrorism deaths. Counting terrorist attacks abroad, she said, would make it an apples to oranges comparison.",
      "The number comes from the nonpartisan think tank the New America Foundation's count of lethal jihadist attacks on U.S. soil from 2005 to 2015. It includes for example the four people killed during the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 and the 13 deaths from the Fort Hood shooting in 2009.",
      "To get to 280,024 gun deaths, NowThis compiled data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Vital Statistics System and the Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowd-sourced project that tallies deaths and injuries in mass shootings.",
      "According to the CDC, the number of violent gun deaths between 2005 and 2013 (the latest year on record) was 279,976. That includes suicides, homicides, and police-related shootings. Mass Shooting Tracker counts 389 mass shooting gun deaths in 2014 and 375 so far in 2015.",
      "There are, however, a few issues with these numbers.",
      "For starters, a spokesperson for New America told us it would have been more accurate to include lives lost to both jihadist and non-jihadist extreme violence (47 deaths from 2005 to 2015) for a total count of 71 deaths from terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.",
      "Secondly, Mass Shooting Tracker, as the name implies, only tracks deaths from mass shootings, defined by the group as when four more people are shot in an event. If we look at all gun-related deaths as the CDC does from the past two years, the numbers are much higher.",
      "According the nonprofit project the Gun Violence Archive, there were 12,562 gun deaths in 2014 and 9,959 in 2015 thus far. That's a grand total of 301,797 firearm-related deaths in the past decade, compared to 71 deaths from domestic acts of terrorism.",
      "",
      "If we factor in terrorist attacks overseas, the comparison is still stark. From 2004 to 2014, 303 Americans were killed in terrorist attacks worldwide, according to State Department reports. During that same time frame, 320,523 Americans were killed because of gun violence. Here's a breakdown:",

      "Since the start of her 2016 campaign, Hillary Clinton hasn't taken a strong position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal -- saying she would reserve judgment until the deal was finalized.",
      "Well, the negotiations recently came to a close, and Clinton promptly announced that she opposes the deal.",
      "\"As of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it,\" she said in an Oct. 8 interview with PBS Newshour's Judy Woodruff, adding, \"I don't believe it's going to meet the high bar I have set.\"",
      "This stance has some people scratching their heads, because she praised the negotiations while serving as secretary of state.",
      "We thought we should take a look back and see how Clinton's position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has evolved. She has addressed the trade deal on a number of occasions since official negotiations started in 2010 (CNN counted at least 45 comments), so we'll note her most representative remarks in chronological order.",
      "Sept. 8, 2010, remarks to the Council on Foreign Relations: \"We want to realize the benefits from greater economic integration. In order to do that, we have to be willing to play. To this end ... we're pursuing a regional agreement with the nations of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we know that that will help create new jobs and opportunities here at home.\"",
      "March 9, 2011, remarks at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum: \"The United States is also making important progress on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will bring together nine APEC economies in a cutting-edge, next generation trade deal, one that aims to eliminate all trade tariffs by 2015 while improving supply change, saving energy, enhancing business practices both through information technology and green technologies.\"",
      "July 8, 2012, remarks with a Japanese official: \"The United States welcomes Japan's interest in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which we think will connect economies throughout the region, making trade and investment easier, spurring exports, creating jobs.\"",
      "Nov. 5, 2012, remarks in Australia: \"This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment.\"",
      "July 2014, in her memoir Hard Choices: \"Because TPP negotiations are still ongoing, it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement. It's safe to say the TPP won't be perfect -- no deal negotiated among a dozen countries ever will be -- but its higher standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit American businesses and workers The TPP became the economic pillar of our strategy in Asia.\"",
      "May 22, 2015, at a press conference in New Hampshire: \"I've been for trade agreements, I've been against trade agreements, voted for some, voted against others, so I want to judge this when I see exactly what exactly is in it and whether or not I think it meets my standards,\" adding she had some \"concerns\" about the TPP.",
      "There is an obvious difference in tenor between Clinton's remarks as a member of the Obama administration and today as a presidential candidate. Across the whole time period, she has said details needed to be hammered out, and they had to meet certain standards. But her comments were more positive on the whole from 2010-13 than they have been recently.",
      "Here are some of the words she used to describe the TPP before she left the State Department in 2013: \"exciting,\" \"innovative,\" \"ambitious,\" \"groundbreaking,\" \"cutting-edge,\" \"high-quality,\" \"high-standard\" and \"gold standard.\" She also publicly encouraged more nations to get involved, such as Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia, and she expressed hope that the negotiations would wrap up by the end of 2012.",
      "As a presidential candidate she has used more hedging language, for example saying she has \"some concerns,\" and now she has said she outright doesn't support the deal as it stands.",
      "While some pundits have painted Clinton's transition as political -- an appeal to liberals who oppose the deal -- she might have legitimately changed her mind. It's possible the deal looks dramatically different than it did at the early stages of negotiations, when Clinton was at the State Department. The negotiations have been conducted in secret, so it's hard for us to assess that ourselves. Also, as secretary of state, she represented the Obama administration, which remains wholeheartedly in favor of the deal.",
      "\"I still believe in the goal of a strong and fair trade agreement in the Pacific as part of a broader strategy both at home and abroad, just as I did when I was secretary of state,\" Clinton said in an Oct. 7 statement. \"I appreciate the hard work that President Obama and his team put into this process and recognize the strides they made. But the bar here is very high and, based on what I have seen, I don't believe this agreement has met it.\"",

      "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested last week that Congress' current investigation into the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, is a political move against former Hillary Clinton, and she was quick to jump on the Republican's gaffe.",
      "In an interview Monday morning, Clinton was visibly frustrated with the ongoing Benghazi investigation.",
      "\"There have been seven investigations led mostly by Republicans in the Congress,\" Clinton said. \"And they were nonpartisan, and they reached conclusions that, first of all, I and nobody did anything wrong, but there were changes we could make. This committee was set up, as they have admitted, for the purpose of making a partisan political issue out of the deaths of four Americans.\"",
      "Is Clinton correct that there have been seven and now eight investigations into Benghazi? We started counting and found she was largely accurate.",
      "Here's what we found.",
      "Background",
      "Clinton was secretary of state when Islamic extremists attacked a U.S. diplomatic mission and a CIA compound in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012. U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans died in the barrage.",
      "In the weeks following the attack, the White House was heavily questioned for its response to the terrorist attack. Many debated, among conflicting reports from intelligence officials, what role al-Qaeda played in the attack and how much the White House knew about the group's involvement. Critics also questioned whether Clinton and the State Department could have better addressed security at the U.S. facilities before they were attacked. The debate got more partisan as time went on, as Republicans began speaking of conspiracy theories and cover-ups.",
      "The seven probes mentioned by Clinton include only those conducted by Congress, but there was at least one more. After the attack, Clinton convened an Accountability Review Board to investigate the incident -- something she was legally required to do. The Board's report found no fault in the State Department for the terrorist attacks but acknowledged \"systematic failures and leadership and management deficiencies\" that left Benghazi vulnerable. Four State Department officials were temporarily suspended and ultimately reassigned within the department.",
      "It should be noted that each congressional committee that investigated the Benghazi attack looked into different aspects of the event. After the attack, Republican Speaker John Boehner directed the House Committees on Oversight and Government Reform, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, Armed Services and Intelligence to investigate the issues within their jurisdictions. The House investigations were led by Republicans. Two bipartisan Senate Committees also investigated the attack.",
      "Clinton said the committees found that she and her department had not committed wrongdoing but suggested changes. Actually, almost every committee report found her department did not adequately address security concerns in Libya or could have done more to prevent the attack. Clinton's words give the best possible spin to the various committee findings, but she's also essentially accurate.",
      "Here's a list of all the congressional investigations and what they found.",
      "Investigation 1: The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform",
      "The House Oversight Committee was one of the first committees to question Clinton following the Benghazi attack. On Sept. 16, 2013, the Republican-led committee released an interim report on the Accountability Review Board appointed by Clinton. The report raised questions about the independence and integrity of the Accountability Review Board (since Clinton appointed the board to investigate her own department) and criticized the conclusions in the board's final report.",
      "Investigation 2: The Senate Committee On Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs",
      "This bipartisan committee released a report in December 2012 detailing the \"high risk\" of a terrorist attack at the U.S. facilities in Libya. While the report criticized the State Department for not addressing the security concerns leading up to the attack, it also found \"administration officials were inconsistent in stating publicly that the deaths in Benghazi were the result of a terrorist attack.\" The report attributed the State Department's security failures to intelligence problems and a failure \"to imagine the type of attack that occurred.\"",
      "Investigation 3: The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence",
      "The Senate Intelligence Committee released a bipartisan report in January 2014 calling the Benghazi attacks \"preventable.\" Among other findings, the committee concluded the State Department had received ample warning about deteriorating security in Libya and failed to adequately increase security in the weeks leading up to the attack. The report also faulted intelligence officials for not relaying information on the CIA annex to the U.S. military.",
      "Investigation 4: The House Committee on Foreign Affairs",
      "Clinton testified before this House committee on Jan. 23, 2013 (she also testified in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier that day). The House Committee on Foreign Affairs later released a report criticizing Clinton and other high-ranking officials who they said were \"provided extensive warning of the deteriorating security environment in eastern Libya.\" The report also criticized the State Department's Accountability Review Board, which \"was seriously deficient in several respects,\" especially in its failure to comment on the actions of the department's highest ranking officials, including Clinton.",
      "Investigation 5: The House Committee on the Judiciary",
      "The focus of the Committee on the Judiciary's probe was the FBI investigation that followed the terrorist attack. The committee released its findings in April 2013 as part of an interim progress report in conjunction with the five other Republican-led committees investigating Benghazi. The report detailed how the FBI did not investigate the scene until three weeks after the attack and spent less than one day collecting evidence in Benghazi. The committee also faulted Clinton for reducing security at the Benghazi consulate, despite her testimony that she \"had no knowledge\" of security requests from the compound.",
      "Investigation 6: The House Committee on Armed Services",
      "The Armed Services Committee began its investigation \"immediately after the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya to evaluate the response of the Department of Defense\" to the attack, according to a February 2014 committee report. The Republican-led committee bashed the Obama administration's failure to address security threats in Benghazi, asserting that the military was unprepared for possible violence in Libya.",
      "Investigation 7: The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence",
      "The House Intelligence Committee concluded its two-year Benghazi investigation in November 2014 when it released a report exonerating the Obama administration of wrongdoing in its response to the attack. The report found evidence of contradicting intelligence among government officials and concluded officials did not intentionally mislead the public with information in the days following the attack.",
      "Ongoing Investigation 8: The House Select Committee on Benghazi",
      "The Republican-led House created the House Select Committee on Benghazi in May 2014 after a conservative watchdog group discovered new State Department emails about the attacks. The committee includes seven Republicans and five Democrats. The group released an interim progress report in May 2015, but the committee's Democrats have been outspoken on the committee's lack of progress.",
      "Clinton, who has faced more scrutiny over Benghazi after it was discovered she used a private email server while serving as Secretary of State, is set to testify before the Benghazi panel on Oct. 22.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Clinton said, \"There have been seven investigations (of Benghazi) led mostly by Republicans in the Congress\" that concluded \"nobody did anything wrong, but there were changes we could make.\"",
      "Clinton's number is correct: there were seven previous congressional probes into the Benghazi attack. Saying these committees were led \"mostly by Republicans\" is also a fair assertion: the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs were the only two committees not led by Republicans. As for her comment that there was no overt wrongdoing, just room for improvement, that's a rosy assessment. But it is also largely accurate. We rate this claim Mostly True."

      "Republican Ben Carson has been criticized for suggesting that gun control enabled the rise of the Nazis and led to the extermination of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust.",
      "But does he have a point?",
      "In his book, A More Perfect Union, Carson wrote that \"German citizens were disarmed by their government in the late 1930s, and by the mid-1940s Hitler's regime had mercilessly slaughtered six million Jews and numerous others whom they considered inferior.",
      "\"Through a combination of removing guns and disseminating deceitful propaganda, the Nazis were able to carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance,\" he wrote.",
      "Carson reiterated that argument at least twice -- in an Oct. 8, 2015, interview with CNN host Wolf Blitzer, and then again in a speech at the National Press Club.",
      "\"You know, mid- to late-30s, they started a program to disarm the people and by mid- to late 40's, look what had happened,\" he said at the Press Club.",
      "PolitiFact decided to analyze Carson's claim on its Truth-O-Meter.",
      "German gun laws",
      "As the Nazi Party rose to power in Germany, it inherited a 1928 gun registration law that had replaced a total ban on gun ownership imposed on a defeated Germany after World War I. The 1928 law created a permit system to own and sell firearms and ammunition.",
      "\"But this order was followed quite rarely, so that largely, only newly bought weapons became registered,\" said Dagmar Ellerbrock, an expert on German gun policies at the Dresden Technical University. \"At that time, most men, and many women, still owned the weapons they acquired before or during the first World War.\"",
      "When they came to power, the Nazis used whatever gun records they had to seize weapons from their enemies, but Ellerbock told us the files included very few of the firearms in circulation.",
      "\"In my records, I found many Jews who well into the late 1930s possessed guns,\" Ellerbock told us.",
      "The Nazis adopted a new gun law in 1938. According to an analysis by Bernard Harcourt, a professor at Columbia University School of Law, it loosened gun ownership rules in several ways.",
      "It deregulated the buying and selling of rifles, shotguns and ammunition. It made handguns easier to own by allowing anyone with a hunting license to buy, sell or carry one at any time. (You didn't need to be hunting.) It also extended the permit period from one year to three and gave local officials more discretion in letting people under 18 get a gun.",
      "The regulations to implement this law, rather than the law itself, did impose new limits on one group: Jews.",
      "On Nov. 11, 1938, the German minister of the interior issued \"Regulations Against Jews Possession of Weapons.\" Not only were Jews forbidden to own guns and ammunition, they couldn't own \"truncheons or stabbing weapons.\"",
      "In addition to the restrictions, Ellerbrock said the Nazis had already been raiding Jewish homes and seizing weapons.",
      "\"The gun policy of the Nazis can hardly be compared to the democratic procedures of gun regulations by law,\" Ellerbrock told us. \"It was a kind of special administrative practice (Sonderrecht), which treated people in different ways according to their political opinion or according to racial identity' in Nazi terms.\"",
      "The power of a police state",
      "In short, Nazi-era Germany imposed greater gun restrictions for Jews (and other perceived enemies) at the same time it loosened gun restrictions for other groups.",
      "But that's not what Carson said. He made a more sweeping claim about Nazis disarming German citizens.",
      "Carson then goes on to say that the lack of guns allowed the Nazis to \"carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance.\"",
      "But a key turning point in the Nazi path to power illustrates that the availability of guns was not a pivotal issue.",
      "Paramilitary organizations were part of the Nazi operation from its earliest days in the mid 1920s. The Sturmabteilung, or Brownshirts, was a founding Nazi street fighting organization. Another outfit, the Schutzstaffel, or SS, provided protection to Nazi officials as they moved about the country. After Hitler won office, the SS under Heinrich Himmler became part of Hitler's inner circle, and Himmler felt the Sturmabteilung was too difficult to control. He and his collaborators concocted a rumor that the Sturmabteilung was plotting a coup.",
      "In 1934, in a span of three days, Himmler's SS units killed between 85 and 200 Sturmabteilung leaders and other perceived enemies.",
      "Hitler himself oversaw the arrest of one of his oldest comrades, Ernst Roehm, the head of the Sturmabteilung. In the middle of that arrest, a truckload of armed Sturmabteilung troops rolled up, but not a shot was fired. Roehm was executed days later.",
      "The staff at the German Historical Institute wrote that with this operation, Hitler had managed to \"legitimize outright murder on a large scale without any legal proceedings whatsoever and that the country largely accepted the Nazi propaganda that presented this strike as necessary.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Carson said that under the Nazis, \"German citizens were disarmed by their government in the late 1930s,\" which allowed the Nazis to \"carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance.\"",
      "This is a misreading of history on two levels. First, German citizens as a whole were not disarmed by the Nazis. Jews and other supposed enemies of the state were subject to having their weapons seized. But for most German citizens, the Nazi period was one in which gun regulations were loosened, not tightened.",
      "Second, a lack of guns was not the issue. If the majority of Germans had wanted to use these guns to fight the Nazis, they could have. But they didn't. Carson ignores that the Nazis enjoyed significant popular support, or at least, broad acquiescence.",

      "In an effort to take out frontrunner Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidates have pelted Trump with criticism over his multiple trips to federal bankruptcy court.",
      "That criticism was on full display in CNN's Republican debate Sept. 16. Most notably, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina criticized Trump's history of bankruptcies in his businesses.",
      "\"You know, there are a lot of us Americans who believe that we are going to have trouble someday paying back the interest on our debt because politicians have run up mountains of debt using other people's money,\" Fiorina said. \"That is in fact precisely the way you ran your casinos. You ran up mountains of debt, as well as losses, using other people's money, and you were forced to file for bankruptcy not once, not twice, four times.\"",
      "Trump doesn't deny that four of his businesses have filed for bankruptcy. He argues, however, that filing for bankruptcy is a common business decision, and he was smart to make the moves when he did.",
      "\"Hundreds of companies\" have filed for bankruptcy, Trump said earlier in the debate. \"I used the law four times and made a tremendous thing. I'm in business. I did a very good job.\"",
      "Trump's four bankruptcies were Chapter 11 reorganizations (named for its location in federal bankruptcy code), which are designed to restructure businesses without shutting them down completely. The purpose is to \"save\" the business, as opposed to other forms of bankruptcy which would liquidate the company, said Michael Venditto, a partner at the ReedSmith law firm who has extensive experience with Chapter 11.",
      "Because they keep coming up, we decided to outline Trump's four bankruptcies. We also talked to some finance experts, who told us Trump is correct that Chapter 11 reorganization is not always the result of bad business decisions.",
      "Bankruptcy 1: The Trump Taj Mahal, 1991",
      "The first bankruptcy associated with Trump was perhaps the most significant in terms of his personal finances, according to news reports at the time. He funded the construction of the $1 billion Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, which opened in 1990. By 1991, the casino was nearly $3 billion in debt, while Trump had racked up nearly $900 million in personal liabilities, so the business decided to file for Chapter 11 reorganization, according to the New York Times. As a result, Trump gave up half his personal stake in the casino and sold his yacht and airline, according to the Washington Post.",
      "Bankruptcy 2: Trump Plaza Hotel, 1992",
      "Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in New York for $390 million in 1988. By 1992, the hotel had accumulated $550 million in debt. As a result of the bankruptcy, in exchange for easier terms on which to pay off the debts, Trump relinquished a 49 percent stake in the Plaza to a total of six lenders, according to ABC News. Trump remained the hotel's CEO, but it was merely a gesture -- he didn't earn a salary and had no say in the hotel's day-to-day operations, according to the New York Times.",
      "Bankruptcy 3: Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts, 2004",
      "Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy again in 2004 when his casinos -- including the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Marina and Trump Plaza casinos in Atlantic City and a riverboat casino in Indiana -- had accrued an estimated $1.8 billion in debt, according to the Associated Press. Trump agreed to reduce his share in the company from 47 to 27 percent in a restructuring plan, but he was still the company's largest single shareholder and remained in charge of its operations. Trump told the Associated Press at the time that the company represented less than 1 percent of his net worth.",
      "Bankruptcy 4: Trump Entertainment Resorts, 2009",
      "Trump Entertainment Resorts -- formerly Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts -- was hit hard by the 2008 economic recession and missed a $53.1 million bond interest payment in December 2008, according to ABC News. After debating with the company's board of directors, Trump resigned as the company's chairman and had his corporate stake in the company reduced to 10 percent. The company continued to use Trump's name in licensing.",
      "So four Trump companies filed for Chapter 11 reorganization. Is that as big a deal as Fiorina says?",
      "Risky business",
      "While it would be better to avoid a situation where Chapter 11 reorganization is necessary, filing for bankruptcy can be a \"sound business decision\" when the company is facing serious financial problems, Venditto said. It's better than the business shutting down completely.",
      "\"However, the source of the financial problems varies from case to case,\" he said. \"Sometimes it is the result of circumstances beyond the control of the business. Sometime it caused by poor judgment. More frequently, it is a combination.\"",
      "Trump's four bankruptcies all happened within the past 25 years. That's a lot, said Stephen Lubben, a leading expert in corporate finance and professor at Seton Hall School of Law. But to be fair, the gaming industry has been struggling the past few years, he added, and three out of four of Trump's bankruptcies were tied to casinos.",
      "It's not fair to put all the blame on Trump for the four bankruptcies because he's acting as any investor would. Investors often own many non-integrated companies, which they fund by taking on debt, and some of them inevitably file for bankruptcy, said Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown University.",
      "He added that people typically wouldn't personally blame former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney or investor Warren Buffett for individual failures within their investment companies, Bain Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, respectively.",
      "\"The only difference is that Trump puts his name on his companies, which means people associate them with him, but he's not at all the leader in the bankruptcy space,\" Levitan said. \"These bankruptcies were not defining moments for Trump and shouldn't color our view of him.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Fiorina said Trump was \"forced to file for bankruptcy not once, not twice, four times.\"",
      "While it is accurate that Trump filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy four times, Fiorina's statement doesn't tell the whole story. In context, Fiorina's phrasing suggests Trump was personally responsible for the failures of these businesses, but in reality, much was out of Trump's control -- such as a struggling casino industry. But Trump is certainly not blameless.",

      "Recently, Hillary Clinton has been making the ultimate pocketbook argument for her candidacy: When there's a Democrat in the White House, she says, the economy does better.",
      "Earlier in this campaign season, she said the stock market does better under Democrats. In a speech to the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention on Sept. 19, Clinton went even further.",
      "\"I know it's inconvenient for our Republican friends, but the facts do speak for themselves,\" the former secretary of state said. \"Economic growth is stronger under Democratic presidents. Unemployment is lower. The stock market rises faster. Businesses do better, and deficits are smaller. And one of my favorite inconvenient facts is under Republicans, recessions happen four times as frequently as under Democrats.\"",
      "In this fact-check, we decided to focus the claim that recessions are four times as likely under Republicans as they are under Democrats.",
      "A look at the numbers",
      "The primary research on this question -- and the source cited by the Clinton campaign when we asked -- comes from a paper written by two Princeton University economists, Alan Blinder and Mark Watson.",
      "The paper, published in July 2014, found that the economy tends to do better under Democratic presidents by numerous measures. The authors looked at quarterly economic data from 1947 through mid 2013 and the National Bureau of Economic Research's official list of recessions and found that Clinton's claim is pretty much on point.",
      "Since 1947, there have been 11 official recessions, totaling 49 recessionary quarters. Of those 49 quarters, just eight occurred under Democratic presidents, compared to 41 under Republicans. So, over the past 65 years, quarters in recession were about five times more common under a Republican president than under a Democratic president.",
      "\"Sec. Clinton is correct in her claim,\" Watson, one of the paper's authors, told PolitiFact.",
      "Looking at how many recessions started under Republicans, the difference is even more stark, noted Blinder, the co-author. Of the 11 recessions since 1947, nine under Republicans, compared to just two under Democrats.",
      "The paper also looked further back in history to 1875 and found that the trend held, though it was less pronounced.",
      "But what does this mean?",
      "Economists emphasize, however, that Clinton's claim needs some additional context.",
      "Clinton presumably wants listeners to believe that Republican policies don't work for the economy. But the research doesn't necessarily support this contention. There are far too many factors that contribute to the country's economic health.",
      "\"Democrats would no doubt like to attribute the large (Democratic/Republican) growth gap to macroeconomic policy choices, but the data do not support such a claim,\" the Blinder-Watson paper says.",
      "In short, the paper found that half of the Democrats' economic advantage is a result of factors outside the control of the White House, Congress or the Federal Reserve. The other half \"remains a mystery,\" Watson said.",
      "\"It seems we must look instead to several variables that are mostly good luck,' with perhaps a touch of good policy,'\" the report says.",
      "One section of the paper (it's on page 14) gives an overview of booms and busts since World War II. It concludes that it's difficult to draw a direct line from a president's fiscal policy positions to economic cycles.",
      "For example, defense spending led to prosperity during the Korean War under Democratic President Harry Truman. His successor, Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, ended the war, and thus the prosperity turned into recession.",
      "Energy price shocks are another important factor, since they can produce economic downturns. Unfortunately for the Republicans, shocks hit during the presidencies of Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and George W. Bush, compared to just once under a Democrat, Jimmy Carter.",
      "The authors add that Democratic presidents have benefited from higher \"total factor productivity,\" which is essentially a measure of technological growth and dynamism. A clear example is the technology boom under Bill Clinton, which produced significant productivity gains. The authors acknowledge that it's unclear why this has been the case under Democratic presidents.",
      "And sometimes the fiscal policy of a previous administration bleeds into the next one -- so just because a recession happened when one president was in office, the prior administration might bear some of the responsibility. While Democratic President Lyndon Johnson saw no recessions, for instance, his administration had to implement anti-inflation policies near the end of his tenure. Those policies contributed to a recession early on in Nixon's term.",
      "Because of all the factors at play, assigning credit for economic results is tricky, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University professor and chief economist for the job site Indeed.com. In fact, it's possible that causation actually runs the other way.",
      "\"It's possible that the public votes in response to economic conditions,\" she added, \"meaning political cycles can follow economic cycles.\"",
      "Our ruling",

      "Call it ricochet politics. First, a questioner at a New Hampshire rally for Donald Trump repeats the lie that President Barack Obama is a Muslim. Trump fails to correct him and faces a round of questions as to why he didn't. Then the host of NBC's Meet the Press asks Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson if it would be okay to have a Muslim president and Carson said, \"I absolutely would not agree with that.\"",
      "This prompts Hillary Clinton to tweet, \"Can a Muslim be President of the United States of America? In a word: Yes. Now let's move on.\"",
      "Then Trump responds with a tweet of his own. \"Just remember, the birther movement was started by Hillary Clinton in 2008. She was all in!\"",
      "The birther movement refers to the long-running myth that Obama was not born in the United States and thus, under the Constitution, could not be president. Trump promoted this belief avidly for several years with anyone who would listen. This week, Trump told Late Show host Stephen Colbert that he doesn't \"talk about it anymore.\"",
      "Did Clinton not just start the birther movement but back it wholeheartedly by being \"all in\"?",

      "The allegation about Obama's birthplace tracks back to the bruising 2008 Democratic primary between Obama and Clinton. According to a Telegraph article, as early as April 2008, a Clinton supporter passed around an email that questioned where Obama was born.",
      "\"Barack Obama's mother was living in Kenya with his Arab-African father late in her pregnancy,\" it said. \"She was not allowed to travel by plane then, so Barack Obama was born there and his mother then took him to Hawaii to register his birth.\"",
      "The cry that Obama was not a legitimate candidate grew much louder in June 2008.",
      "On June 7, 2008, Clinton conceded and called for all Democrats to rally behind Obama. Some in her party did not care to listen. By June 10, 2008, opponents to Obama were posting on a website called Pumaparty.com. PUMA stood for Party Unity My Ass. The website encouraged frustrated Clinton supporters to back the Republican nominee.",
      "",
      "John Avlon, editor-in-chief of the Daily Beast, explored the roots of the birther movement in his book Wingnuts: How the Lunatic Fringe Is Hijacking America. Avlon described a posting on the PUMA website with the heading \"Obama May Be Illegal to Be Elected President!\" He wrote that a Clinton volunteer in Texas, Linda Starr, played a key role in spreading the rumor.",
      "Starr connected with Pennsylvania attorney Philip Berg in August and Berg followed up by suing in federal court to block Obama's nomination. The suit was thrown out repeatedly on the grounds that Berg lacked standing and the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately refused to hear his appeal.",
      "There is no record that Clinton herself or anyone within her campaign ever advanced the charge that Obama was not born in the United States. A review by our fellow fact-checkers at Factcheck.org reported that no journalist who investigated this ever found a connection to anyone in the Clinton organization.",
      "Clinton, herself, answered this very accusation after Trump's tweet during an interview with CNN's Don Lemon. Lemon asked Clinton if she started smear campaigns that Obama was born outside the United States.",
      "\"That is no. That is so ludicrous, Don. You know, honestly, I just believe that, first of all, it's totally untrue, and secondly, you know, the president and I have never had any kind of confrontation like that,\" Clinton said. \"You know, I have been blamed for nearly everything, that was a new one to me.\"",

      "One proposal boosting Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders' support among college-aged voters is his promise of free tuition at public colleges and universities.",
      "In an interview with Sanders, CNN's Erin Burnett asked about some of the issues Sanders' critics bring up about the proposal, like the large cost of such a program and persuading states to get on board.",
      "But Sanders said he has a way to pay for it: Wall Street.",
      "\"I think the idea is sound,\" Sanders said in the March 30 interview. \"It is paid for, Erin, by a tax on Wall Street's speculation. When Wall Street's illegal behavior destroyed our economy, the middle class bailed them out. It is now time for them to help the middle class.\"",
      "Sanders' assertion that the Wall Street speculation tax pays for his college tuition plan is only part of the story. Two-thirds, to be exact.",
      "Sanders estimates that his plan to make undergraduate tuition at public colleges and universities free would cost about $75 billion annually. Based on his proposed College for All Act, the federal government would fund two-thirds of that cost using a tax on Wall Street trading, but participating states would have to kick in the remaining costs.",
      "Sanders' Wall Street tax proposal primarily taxes the rich in order to provide services to the non-wealthy. It would put a small tax on speculative financial trades, like stocks, bonds and derivatives.",
      "The revenue potential for such a tax is huge because the volume of Wall Street trading is so large. One estimate which Sanders points to put the yearly revenue from a financial transaction tax at more than $300 billion.",
      "The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center analyzed Sanders' plan and put the yearly revenue at around $50 billion to $60 billion, much more modest but still enough to cover the approximately $50 billion a year in federal dollars Sanders wants to put in his tuition program. (The difference in revenue estimates largely has to do with how the analysts measured the various taxable trades and the impact of the policy.)",
      "Setting aside a disagreement over how much a Wall Street tax would raise, in any case, Sanders' own proposal is straightforward about the fact that the tax revenue will not fund the free public school tuition 100 percent. And as CNN's Burnett noted, there is some concern among skeptics of Sanders' proposal about this piece in particular: What if state governments don't want to play ball and refuse to kick in the remaining one-third of program costs?",
      "For example, many states have resisted federal dollars for expanding Medicaid, the low-income health insurance program, under the Affordable Care Act, even though the federal government would provide at minimum 90 percent of the funds to expand the program.",
      "In order to receive federal funding for Sanders' education proposal, states would have to meet other requirements designed to maintain high educational standards, like reducing the number of low-paid adjunct faculty and maintaining state funding for need-based financial aid. This, combined with the fact that state funding for higher education is tight across the country, raises the question of how states particularly those whose governments are spending-averse will respond to such a proposal and how that will affect students living in those states.",
      "In the CNN interview, Sanders said if a state chooses not to participate, it can expect its students to flock to a state that does.",
      "But Sanders is offering a generous deal that might be too good to pass up, said Barmak Nassirian, director of federal relations and policy analysis at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. He said the amount of federal money Sanders is putting on the table exceeds what states take in with undergraduate tuition, so they shouldn't have to worry about a shortfall as a result of Sanders' program.",
      "\"But it is theoretically possible that some state does not take federal money,\" Nassirian said, noting that Sanders' proposal is massive and won't necessarily be politically feasible to implement.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Sanders said his free public university tuition program \"is paid for by a tax on Wall Street's speculation.\"",
      "Sanders' $75 billion proposal is a federal matching program, meaning the Wall Street speculation tax would cover two-thirds of the costs. States would be required to pick up the tab for the remaining one-third. There is some question if some states would participate in the program. Recently, states have refused to be part of Medicaid expansion under a more generous style of cost-sharing.",
      "Sanders has a point that his proposed Wall Street tax would cover part of the plan, but he left out the significant state contribution. And it's not a sure thing that every state would join in. So we rate his claim Mostly False."

So when on April 5, 2016, one of the hosts of ABC's The View began a question to Hillary Clinton with the fact that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders had won five out of the past six contests, Clinton made sure that didn't hang in the air very long.",
      "\"You have to look at the broader perspective,\" Clinton said. \"He's won some, and I've won some, but I have 2 and a half million more votes than he does. And I have a very significant lead in delegates.\" (Separately, Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook made the same claim in an April 4 Medium post titled, \"To Hillary Clinton supporters: The facts on where the race stands.\")",
      "Does Clinton have a 2.5 million-vote lead over Sanders?",
      "We asked both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns for their numbers. Sanders' staff pointed us to a spreadsheet produced by Fair Vote, an advocacy group that supports new approaches to voting to reduce partisanship. The Clinton campaign also sent us their election vote tally.",
      "There's really only one significant hitch in all of the data. For states that hold primaries, you can see how many votes were cast for Clinton and Sanders. That also true for some, but not all, caucus states. So for example, Colorado held a caucus and Sanders got 71,928 votes compared with Clinton's 49,256.",
      "But for Iowa, Nevada and Maine, the only numbers that get reported are the delegates awarded to each candidate. The ratio of delegates to votes varies from precinct to precinct so there's no way to do some simple math to get to the underlying number of votes.",
      "Sam Lau, communications director for the Iowa Democratic Party, told us \"I don't know of any data on this.\" The situation is the same for Nevada and Maine. And a Washington Democratic Party staffer told us they would have the raw vote tallies eventually, but right now, they were still getting packets sent in from around the state and tabulating them.",
      "Where does that leave us?",
      "Well, with the Wisconsin vote not yet in, based on the Fair Vote totals, the primary tallies stand at 8,746,692 for Clinton compared to 6,049,960 for Sanders. This gives Clinton nearly 2.7 million votes more than her rival.",
      "But when we factor in the caucuses with full vote counts, Clinton's margin drops to a bit over 2.5 million. (Those states are Utah, Nebraska, Minnesota, Kansas, Idaho, Hawaii, Colorado and Alaska.)",
      "Would the actual votes from the remaining caucuses in Iowa, Nevada, and Maine, as well as Washington, change the totals very much?",
      "No one can say for sure, because literally, no one has the numbers. One can run some rough estimates by taking the estimated Democratic turnout and allocating them by the same percentage as the delegates that were awarded.",
      "Do that and Clinton loses about another 100,000 votes compared to Sanders.",
      "Rob Richie, executive director at Fair Vote, told us that approach is flawed, but his sense is the result is about right.",
      "\"At the end of the day, Clinton has between 2.4 (million) and 2.5 million more votes than Sanders,\" Richie said. \"It's a little less, but not too much less, than what you see now.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Clinton said she has received 2.5 million more votes than Sanders. That claim can't be completely verified because we don't have the raw vote totals from the caucus states of Iowa, Nevada, Washington and Maine.",
      "However, given the numbers we do have, it is likely that Clinton's lead is at least in the neighborhood of 2.4 million votes.",

      "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders took some heat from CNN's Jake Tapper during an April 3 interview. The topic: The degree of public transparency Sanders has provided for his tax returns.",
      "Tapper brought up the topic: \"I'm kind of surprised that you haven't gone further on transparency. You released the summary page of your 2014 tax returns. Hillary Clinton has posted on her website the last eight years of her personal returns, all of the returns. Before the New York primary, will you match her? Will you post your full returns for the last eight years?\"",
      "Sanders responded, \"You know who does our tax returns? My wife does our tax returns. We've been a little bit busy lately. So we will get out as much information as we can. There ain't going to be very much exciting in that. I get a salary from the United States Senate, you know, there's not going to be anything new in it that people haven't seen for the last many years, but we will get it out as soon as we can.\"",
      "Tapper wasn't satisfied. \"But nobody has seen them at all, I guess, is the point, and whether or not there's anything exciting in them....\"",
      "At this point, Sanders interjected, \"No, that is not true. That is not true. Of course, we have released them in the past. Our financial situation, to the best of my knowledge, has not changed very much, but we will get out all of that information as soon as we can.\"",
      "How transparent has Sanders been with his tax past returns? Not very, compared with others in the 2016 presidential field. Here's a closer look.",
      "As our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker have noted, Tax Analysts, a publisher specializing in tax policy, has been collecting publicly available tax returns of presidential candidates and other top officials for its Tax History Project. This archive goes back as far as the 1913 tax returns of future president Franklin D. Roosevelt.",
      "Here's a look at what their current archive of the 2016 candidates looks like:",
      "",
      "",
      "In other words, among the candidates still in the race, Sanders' releases are less extensive than anybody's but Donald Trump. (Trump, too, has faced criticism for refusing to share his returns.)",
      "And Sanders' shortcomings are actually bigger than the screenshot above would suggest. The 2014 filings Sanders released consist of just the first two summary pages of his Form 1040 and the equivalent summary pages from his home-state Vermont tax form.",
      "Why does this matter? Unlike most of the other candidates, Sanders has not released the succeeding pages -- the nitty gritty detail of things like charitable donations and other types of itemized deductions. For instance, Clinton's release for tax year 2014 is 44 pages long, or more than 10 times the length of Sanders' for the same year.",
      "It's worth noting that Sanders, as a member of Congress, files annual financial disclosures, which are accessible online back to 2012. And as a presidential candidate, he also files financial disclosure documents to the Federal Election Commission.",
      "But tax returns are much more detailed. And despite what Sanders said in the exchange with Tapper, his campaign did not provide PolitiFact with any earlier, publicly available tax forms. The campaign told the Post that it has not released any other tax returns prior to 2014. (The campaign did tell PolitiFact that they would release his 2015 returns once they are filed.)",
      "Tax and disclosure experts we contacted agreed that Sanders' current disclosures are weak by historical standards.",
      "\"If I filed the first two pages of my return with the IRS, it would not take long for them to ding me,\" said Kenneth A. Gross of the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and a specialist in political disclosure and ethics. \"There is a lot of information on the pages following the cover pages.\"",
      "Joseph J. Thorndike, the Tax Analysts official who heads the Tax History Project, agreed.",
      "Sanders \"has not, in fact, released his most recent tax return,\" Thorndike said. \"He has released a portion of that return. The IRS would not accept a Form 1040 as a complete return and neither should voters. Also, it's worth noting that Sanders has not released any portion of his older returns. If Mitt Romney had tried to release an incomplete return in 2012, the media would never have accepted it.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Sanders told Tapper that his campaign has released his past tax returns.",
      "Sanders said his 2015 return is forthcoming, and he has made other types of disclosures in the past, including congressional and presidential-candidate filings. But his releases of prior-year tax forms -- the specific documents Tapper asked about -- have been limited in several ways. He's only released information for one year, which pales compared to most other recent presidential candidates, and even that year's release only includes a summary page, not the full return.

      "Responding to a Washington Post article that cast Clinton's comments as questioning his qualifications, Sanders shot back, saying Clinton is the one who's unqualified, upsetting Clinton's supporters and former president-husband.",
      "The tiff leveled off Friday when Sanders took back his statement and said \"of course\" Clinton is qualified. But Sunday on Meet the Press, Sanders said his point all along was Clinton lacks good judgment.",
      "\"Well, when you vote for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs,\" he said, \"when you support and continue to support fracking, despite the crisis that we have in terms of clean water, and essentially, when you have a super PAC that is raising tens of millions of dollars from every special interest out there, including $15 million from Wall Street, the American people do not believe that that is the kind of president that we need to make the changes in America to protect the working families of this country.\"",
      "There's a lot to fact-check in this statement, but we were particularly curious about Sanders' claim that Clinton supported \"virtually every trade agreement.\"",
      "Sanders is exaggerating slightly, but he has a point that Clinton has been largely in favor of free trade. His claim that these deals have cost the country \"millions of jobs\" is up for debate.",
      "Clinton's position on free trade",
      "Unlike Sanders' two decades of consistent opposition to free trade agreement, Clinton has zigzagged through the years.",
      "\"Some people are generally pro-trade or anti-trade. She's case-by-case on trade,\" Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council in both the Clinton and Obama administrations, told the Washington Post last year.",
      "As first lady, Clinton spoke favorably in the 1990s and in the early 2000s of the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed by President Bill Clinton.",
      "\"Creating a free trade zone in North America the largest free trade zone in the world would expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization. Although unpopular with labor unions, expanding trade opportunities was an important administration goal,\" she wrote in her 2003 memoir, Living History.",
      "As a senator from New York, Clinton had the opportunity to vote on 10 trade deals. She said yes to six and no to the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) and the deal with Andean countries. She skipped the votes on agreements with Jordan and Peru, which came up when she was running for president the first time, but supported both deals.",
      "Clinton explained her seemingly inconsistent positions in a 2005 speech to Congress: \"The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement included internationally recognized enforceable labor standards in the text of the agreement. Sadly, DR-CAFTA is a step backward.\"",
      "While the deals with Chile, Australia and Singapore similarly excluded labor rights standards, Clinton said she \"supported these agreements despite these concerns because I believed the agreements would not harm the average working person in those nations.\"",
      "However, Clinton (as well as then Rep. Sanders) voted against the Trade Act of 2002, which expanded duty-free exports from Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru and gave President George W. Bush \"fast-track authority\" to approve trade deals with South American countries.",
      "The Sanders campaign pointed out that Clinton supported normalizing trade relations with China while campaigning for Senate in 2000, and, once elected, she also voted for legislation that included an amendment granting Vietnam normalized trade status. (Sanders voted against both.)",
      "As a presidential candidate in 2008, Clinton had varying opinions on various trade deals, and she changed her position on NAFTA. She called NAFTA \"a mistake\" and opposed pending deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. She reiterated her support for free trade with Peru on the campaign trail.",
      "\"I support the trade agreement with Peru. It has very strong labor and environmental protections. This agreement makes meaningful progress on advancing workers' rights, and also levels the playing field for American workers,\" she said in 2007. \"The South Korean agreement does not create a level playing field for American carmakers. I am very concerned about the history of violence against trade unionists in Colombia. And as long as the head of Panama's National Assembly is a fugitive from justice in America, I cannot support that agreement.\"",
      "As secretary of state, Clinton walked back her opposition to deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, and helped negotiate them as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Clinton has reiterated her opposition to CAFTA and flip-flopped on her support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership.",

      "Business groups, on the other hand, argue that trade deals actually boost employment. For example, a 2010 report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that the 14 trade deals in place in 2008 supported 5.4 million jobs.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S-China Business Council and the Financial Times contend that the loss in manufacturing jobs were not due to trade with China so much as gains in technology and productivity, as well as the result of a more sophisticated economy.",

      "Was Sanders telling the fracking truth? (We examined Clinton's support for free trade in a separate fact-check.)",

Some environmentalists, though, are doubtful that it's that much better than coal or oil, given reports that fracking can cause methane leaks (a greenhouse gas that's much more potent than carbon dioxide) and earthquakes and set water ablaze.",
      "Clinton clearly supported the practice as secretary of state. Her special envoy for international energy affairs launched the Global Shale Gas Initiative encouraging other countries to explore shale as an energy source.",
      "An in-depth investigation by progressive magazine Mother Jones said that Clinton's support of fracking was \"part of a broader push to fight climate change, boost global energy supply, and undercut the power of adversaries such as Russia that use their energy resources as a cudgel.\"",
      "We found instances of Clinton and the State Department talking up fracking to Latin America, the European Union, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria, Pakistan, China and India.",
      "\"The United States will promote the use of shale gas. Now, I know that in some places is controversial. But natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel available for power generation today, and a number of countries in the Americas may have shale gas resources,\" Clinton said in a 2009 speech to the Inter-American Development Bank.",
      "After Clinton left the State Department in 2013, she continued to support fracking but repeatedly called for \"smart regulations\" in speeches and in her book, Hard Choices.",
      "Fracking with nuance in 2016",
      "Compared with Sanders' unequivocal opposition and the Republicans' strong support, Clinton has a more complicated answer when it comes to fracking. Essentially, she supports it as long as there's environmental oversight and no local opposition.",
      "Here's how Clinton detailed her position during the March 6 debate in Flint, Michigan:",
      "\"I don't support it when any locality or any state is against it, No. 1. I don't support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present. I don't support it No. 3 unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using.",
      "So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place. And I think that's the best approach, because right now, there are places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated.\"",
      "(\"My answer is a lot shorter,\" responded Sanders. \"No, I do not support fracking.\")",
      "Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin referred us to Clinton's plan \"to address the fracking-related risks people are concerned about.\"",
      "\"This is particularly important given that the federal government doesn't get to say where fracking occurs and where it doesn't, but can put new safeguards in place,\" Schwerin said.",
      "Katie Brown of Energy in Depth, the research and education arm of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, told PolitiFact that Sanders' position to ban all fracking is outside the mainstream.",
      "\"Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, joins Democrats across the county such as Sen. Chuck Schumer, and California Gov. Jerry Brown, and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (just to name a few), who have all touted strong regulations by the states and supported fracking for its environmental and economic benefits,\" Brown said.",
      "Warren Gunnels, Sanders' policy director, referred us to a Reuters article, in which supporters of fracking cast Clinton's comments as campaign rhetoric and opponents urged her to cut the caveats and ban it outright.",

      "A portrait of regulated extraction",
      "Clinton's three conditions would uphold existing bans and add new ones to the mix. But they wouldn't amount to a universal ban.",
      "The first condition leaves local and state bans in place, such as those in Vermont, New York and a few dozen cities and counties across America.",
      "Her second condition would add dozens of sites that have methane emissions or water contamination.",
      "Natural gas is primarily methane, so we'll assume Clinton is talking about \"fugitive emissions\" or leaks. Estimates for fugitive emissions, typically expressed as a percentage of the total production, vary widely. A round up of studies by watchdog blog Carbon Brief found estimates ranging from 0.6 to 9 percent (the threshold for being cleaner than coal is 3.2 percent).",
      "Various industry and independent research has indicated that a good chunk of leaks come from a small number of \"super-emitters\" (roughly one in 25 facilities, according to a 2015 Colorado State University study). Clinton could ostensibly shut down these methane spewers, which include, for example, about 50 production sites in northern Texas and four lift wells in the Gulf Coast.",
      "Water contamination is not systemic, according to a controversial 2015 EPA study, which nonetheless identified 151 cases of fracking fluid spills in 11 states from 2006 to 2012. Robert Howarth, a noted critic of fracking and biogeochemist at Cornell University, estimates at least 4 percent of production wells pollute water, but contends that the problem is widespread given the sheer number of wells.",
      "Under Clinton's condition, fracking could be banned in, for example, at least 25 counties in Pennsylvania and at least 12 counties in Colorado, if not in all 11 states with noted cases of spills.",
      "Frackers are already meeting Clinton's third condition, to an extent. At least 26 states have some rules on chemical disclosure on the books, though most allow frackers to protect \"trade secrets,\" according to the American Chemical Society.",
      "In addition, the Obama administration now requires drillers on federal and tribal lands to report the composition of their fracking fluid to FracFocus, an industry-backed registry of more than 100,000 wells across America. (Here's an example.)",
      "Environmentalists contend that these rules are not nearly enough. Howarth told PolitiFact that chemical additives are \"a small part of the problem.\"",
      "\"The frack return fluids are full of really nasty materials in addition to the additives, and the precise nature of this toxic brew is seldom known,\" he said. \"Clinton's focus on just the additives is misguided.\"",

      "When Donald Trump laid out the fundamentals of his foreign policy at a Washington hotel conference room, he offered his go-to proof of sound judgment.",
      "\"I was totally against the war in Iraq, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East,\" he said April 27, 2016.",
      "Not in any way we could find. Let's review the record of what Trump said when about the Iraq War.",
      "The war began in March 2003. We searched the Nexis database of transcripts and news reports from 2002 to 2008. From what we found, if Trump saw regional destabilization on the horizon, he kept it under wraps.",
      "In a September 2002 interview, shock jock Howard Stern asked Trump if he supported the Iraq invasion.",
      "Trump responded, \"Yeah, I guess so.\"",
      "That isn't a ringing endorsement of the war, but Trump did not decry the march toward military action in the way thousands of protesters had been doing for months in 2002.",
      "On Jan. 28, 2003, just under three months before the invasion, Fox News' Neil Cavuto asked Trump whether President George W. Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy.",
      "Speaking of Iraq, Trump said, \"Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet, and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.\"",
      "Trump seems to be skeptical of the mission in Iraq here, and he said the economy should be a higher priority. But he did not say anything that resembles his claim that Bush should not proceed because a war would \"destabilize the Middle East.\"",
      "About a week after the war began, Trump gave a mix of views. At an Academy Awards after-party, Trump said that \"the war's a mess,\" according to the Washington Post. But he also told Fox News that because of the war, \"The market's going to go up like a rocket.\"",
      "On Sept. 11, 2003, Trump told MSNBC, \"It wasn't a mistake to fight terrorism and fight it hard, and I guess maybe if I had to do it, I would have fought terrorism but not necessarily Iraq.\"",
      "By 2004, Trump begins to take a tougher stand against the war. (A big hat-tip to Buzzfeed for this.)",
      "On April 16, 2004, Trump is back with Stern.",
      "\"I think Iraq is a terrible mistake,\" Trump said. \"And to think that when we leave, it's gonna be this nice democratic country. I mean, give me a break. There's usually a reason why a country is run a certain way.\"",
      "Trump amplified on that in an August 2004 article in Esquire:",
      "\"Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over. And he'll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam didn't have.",
      "\"What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!\"",
      "In November 2004, he told CNN's Larry King, \"I do not believe that we made the right decision going into Iraq, but, you know, hopefully, we'll be getting out.\"",

      "Clinton appears to have selective hearing.",
      "In saying Comey called her answers \"truthful,\" Clinton was apparently referring to and putting a positive spin on a comment Comey made in a July 7 congressional hearing regarding Clinton's closed-door interview with the FBI as part of their investigation. Comey said, \"We have no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI.\"",
      "In her interview with Wallace, Clinton was making the point that what she told the public is consistent with what she told the FBI, and Comey said what she told the FBI was \"truthful,\" campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin said.",
      "So Clinton's statement implies that Comey has confirmed that her public comments are accurate. That is incorrect.",
      "Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked Comey at the July 7 congressional hearing, \"Did she lie to the public?\"",
      "Comey responded, \"That's a question I'm not qualified to answer.\"",
      "He also said he hadn't compared Clinton's public comments with the FBI interview to see if there were inconsistencies. There is no transcript of the FBI interview.",
      "When Comey announced the FBI's findings July 5, it was clear that there are obvious inconsistencies between what Clinton said publicly about classified information on her private email server before her FBI interview and what the FBI found. Pointedly, Clinton said there wasn't any classified information in her email, and he said there was.",
      "Take the video Wallace played on Fox News Sunday. In it, Clinton said, \"I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified materials\" (March 10, 2015); \"I am confident that I never sent nor received any information that was classified at the time\" (July 25, 2015); \"I had not sent classified material nor received anything marked classified\" (Aug. 18, 2015).",
      "But Comey reported that, of the tens of thousands of emails investigators reviewed, 113 individual emails contained classified information, and three of them bore markings signifying their classification status. (Information can still be classified even if it does not have a label.) Eight email threads contained top-secret information, the highest level of classification, 36 contained secret information, and the remaining eight contained confidential information.",
      "About 2,000 emails have been retroactively classified, or up-classified, meaning the information was not classified when it was emailed, but it is now.",
      "\"Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,\" Comey said in a July 5 statement.",
      "Then, there was this exchange between Comey and Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., at the congressional hearing:",
      "Gowdy: \"Secretary Clinton said there was nothing marked classified on her emails either sent or received. Was that true?\"",
      "Comey: \"That's not true.\"",
      "Gowdy: \"Secretary Clinton said, I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material.' Was that true?\"",

      "In fairness to Clinton, Comey said some of the classified emails were insufficiently marked, and it's understandable that she didn't realize that some of the ones without labels were actually classified.",
      "But he also said of some of the classified emails that did not bear markings, \"There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about the matters should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.\"",
      "We'll also note a couple other major inconsistencies between Clinton's remarks and the FBI's findings:",
      "Clinton repeatedly said she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department in 2014, about 30,000 emails. However, Comey said FBI investigators uncovered \"several thousand\" work-related emails that she had not handed over to the State Department.",
      "And, Clinton has said her email servers \"had numerous safeguards. It was on property guarded by the Secret Service. And there were no security breaches.\"",
      "Comey said that while there's no evidence anyone successfully hacked Clinton's email servers, they certainly were susceptible to attack. There was no full-time security staff, which are found at government agencies and commercial email providers like Google. Further, he noted that Clinton used her personal email abroad, which could have allowed \"hostile actors\" to access her account.",

He's tweeted about dead voters delivering President Barack Obama's victory in 2012, floated charges about multiple voting in the primaries, and suggested that undocumented immigrants \"just walk in and vote\" in some polling places.",

      "\"Nov. 8, we'd better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged,\" he said at an Aug. 1 rally in Columbus, Ohio. \"People are going to walk in and they're going to vote 10 times, maybe, who knows?\"",
      "\"I know last time, you had precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the Republican (Mitt Romney),\" he said to Fox News' Sean Hannity that same night. \"I'm telling you, Nov. 8, we better be careful because that election is going to be rigged and I hope the Republicans are watching closely, or it's going to be taken away from us.\"",

      "While some precincts in Philadelphia exclusively voted for Obama in 2012, it's grasping for straws to claim this is evidence for election rigging.",
      "Defending Trump, Fox's Sean Hannity pointed to a Philadelphia Inquirer article that showed 59 precincts in inner-city Philadelphia in which \"Mitt Romney did not get a single vote, not one.\"",
      "But Hannity leaves out that the same article also stated that \"such results may not be so startling after all.\" The Inquirer wrote that 75 to 80 percent of voters in big cities like Philadelphia identify as Democrats, and 93 percent of African-Americans voted for Obama.",
      "When the paper sought out the few registered Republicans living in the 59 districts, it found that several had moved, others didn't realize they were registered with the party, and others confirmed that they had voted for Obama despite their political identification.",
      "Election inspector Ryan Godfrey, an independent who was a Republican in 2012, called Hannity's claims \"absurd and personally insulting.\" After all, Godfrey argued, there's a paper trail for the ballots in Philly and no evidence that he and the other election officials had risked prosecution to collude against Romney.",
      "Plus, CNN's Brian Stelter countered, \"a Google search would show that there are also precincts in other states, like in Utah, where Obama did not get a single vote.\"",
      "Trumped up charges of voter fraud",
      "Trump's claims of voter fraud, which echo arguments for voter ID laws, are also not reflective of reality.",
      "While the U.S. Government Accountability Office has acknowledged that it's difficult to estimate how often voter fraud happens based on reported incidents, the evidence for rampant fraud is lacking.",
      "News 21 found just 150 alleged cases of double voting, 56 cases of noncitizens voting, and 10 cases of voter impersonation across all elections from 2000 to 2011. Many of these never led to charges, while others were acquitted or dismissed. Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School and an expert on voter fraud, found an even smaller number: 31 credible incidents out of more than 1 billion votes cast from 2000 to 2014.",
      "Put it in another way: You're more likely to get struck by lightning than to find voter fraud.",
      "When voter fraud does occur, it's not always intentional. Multiple studies have traced known cases not to willful deception but to clerical errors or confusion.",
      "For example, one case of a dead person voting (Alan J. Mandell) happened because a poll worker accidentally marked his name instead of the man who actually cast the ballot, Alan J. Mandel. Similarly, in one of just five cases of a noncitizen voting between 2000 and 2004, a permanent resident was told he was eligible and given a voter registration form by a DMV clerk when renewing his license.",
      "So, given the rarity of occurrence, the lack of intent, and a federal penalty of a $10,000 fine or up to five years in prison, experts say it would be extremely difficult to rig an election through the ways Trump has suggested.",
      "\"I'd like to see him try to vote 10 times on Election Day. It would be virtually impossible and a knuckle-headed way to try to corrupt an election,\" said Lorraine Minnite, a political science professor at Rutgers University who wrote The Myth of Voter Fraud.",
      "To sway an election, an army of voters would have to visit multiple polling locations each, know the names and addresses of the people they were impersonating and produce fake ID's or forge their signatures plus be willing to commit perjury the entire time.",
      "\"Campaigns don't pay people to pretend to be people they're not. That's too stupid,\" said Mary Frances Berry, former chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and author of Five Dollars and a Pork Chop Sandwich, a book about electoral fraud.",
      "How to rig an election",
      "From New York's Tammany Hall to the motto of \"vote early and often\" popularized in Chicago, election fraud is certainly part of U.S. political history. But election rigging today is constrained to local elections, as implementing a national election heist would be extremely difficult.",
      "\"Given the decentralized nature of our elections, there would be no single way to throw the results,\" said Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine. \"Instead you'd have to target enough states to make a difference in the Electoral College.\"",
      "The first way is through buying votes, especially absentee ballots.",
      "Berry's Five Dollars and a Pork Chop Sandwich, which refers to the prize a Louisiana woman received for her vote, documents several cases of local campaigns and political machines purchasing votes, often from nursing homes and poor communities, in exchange for cash, whiskey or a paved driveway.",
      "This is possible on a small scale because of a \"corrupt deal\" between local election officials and \"family fiefdoms\" with deep roots in municipal politics, Berry said.",
      "Presidential elections, on the other hand, are under much more scrutiny than sheriff races and subject to federal prosecution. For that reason, and given how complicated organizing the conspiracy across different communities would be, Berry says it's not probable that a national campaign or outside group would take the risk to buy a few votes.",
      "The second way of rigging elections is through tampering with voting machines (looking at you, Olivia Pope of Scandal). Trump suggested this in 2012 when he warned that machines were switching Romney votes to Obama.",
      "\"That's not an indication of the system being rigged. That's an indication that it's lost its calibration,\" said Pamela Smith of Verified Voting, which monitors technological issues in elections.",
      "She added that Trump likely was referring to voter reports of this common issue of overuse, while election rigging \"would require you not noticing.\" (Smith couldn't think of any examples of machines being tampered with and said, from her research, issues usually result from programming errors.)",
      "Ballots cast on some electronic voting systems, however, don't have a paper trail, meaning the votes are not verifiable. Hackers could theoretically alter the results. But this would also require a potential wrongdoer to physically access the machines on Election Day and serious coordination to circumvent all the security and auditing measures in place before, during and after voting, said Smith, adding, \"There are very few paths in the present scenario to flip something off the radar.\"",
      "There's the added security of Pennsylvania law, which mandates post-election vote audits of randomly selected precincts. The majority of precincts in Virginia rely on paper ballots. And Florida, where use of electronic machines is fairly limited to providing accessibility for voters with disabilities, has a Republican governor (Gov. Rick Scott, a Trump supporter) and secretary of state (who oversees elections).",
      "\"Technological rigging or the more classic stuffing of the ballot box are not the kind of things that could be easily done or on the kind of scale that could affect an election,\" Hasen said. \"Trump's unsupported allegations are dangerous and fantasy.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. election system is rigged.",
      "He has cited examples of voter fraud, which is extremely rare, often unintentional and not on a scale large enough to affect a national election.",
      "While there are isolated examples of bought local elections, experts say it cannot be replicated on a national scale. While it is possible to tamper with electronic voting machines, there is no evidence deliberate malfeasance has altered any election.",

      "During what his campaign billed as a major foreign-policy address in Youngstown, Ohio, Donald Trump seemed to take credit for pushing NATO toward a sharper focus on terrorism.",
      "\"If I become president, the era of nation-building will be brought to a very swift and decisive end,\" Trump said. \"Our new approach -- which must be shared by both parties in America, by our allies overseas and by our friends in the Middle East -- must be to halt the spread of radical Islam. All actions should be oriented around this goal and any country which shares this goal will be our ally.\"",
      "He went on to add, \"We will also work very closely with NATO on this new mission. I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism. Since my comments, they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats.\"",
      "Trump has indeed mused publicly that NATO might be \"obsolete\" because the alliance is \"not meant for terrorism.\" But we wondered whether he was correct to say that the U.S.-led military alliance has \"changed their policy and now (has) a new division focused on terror threats.\"",
      "As it turns out, we found very little accurate with this statement.",
      "What change at NATO is he referring to?",
      "We didn't hear back from Trump's campaign, and unlike other portions of the prepared speech, this particular claim was not documented with footnotes.",
      "However, when we checked with experts on NATO and terrorism, several said the likeliest change that Trump would have been referring to was the creation of an assistant secretary general for intelligence and security to head a newly established Joint Intelligence and Security Division.",
      "Trump has previously tweeted out a Wall Street Journal story on the news and said the alliance \"made the change without giving me credit.\"",
      "",
      "The new position was officially announced in a communiqu released on July 9, 2016, by member-state representatives at a summit in Warsaw, Poland. Here's what the document said:",
      "\"To position the Alliance in responding to evolving threats, NATO intelligence reform must be an ongoing, dynamic process. ... To improve NATO's ability to draw on a wide range of intelligence resources, we have agreed to establish a new Joint Intelligence and Security Division to be led by an Assistant Secretary General for Intelligence and Security. The new Assistant Secretary General for Intelligence and Security will direct NATO's intelligence and security activities, ensuring better use of existing personnel and resources, while maximizing the efficient use of intelligence provided by Allies.\"",
      "Was this a major change?",
      "Not really, experts say.",
      "\"NATO members have been complaining about sharing of intelligence for generations,\" said Stephen M. Saideman, a professor of international affairs at Carleton University in Canada who had a fellowship on the U.S. Joint Staff at NATO in 2001. \"Every year or two, there is a discussion about how to improve intel sharing.\" This change, he said, was \"not that important.\"",
      "Jorge Benitez, director of NATOSource at the Atlantic Council, agreed. \"While the top position is new, it seems most of the staff will come from an internal reorganization of NATO bureaucracy, rather than new additions,\" he said. \"This is because the summit communique describes this new NATO division as making better use of existing personnel and resources.' \"",
      "More to the point, Trump's comment gives the impression that NATO hadn't been responsive to terrorism until the new division was created. That's not true at all.",
      "NATO involvement in counter-terrorism issued its first formal declaration on terrorism in 1980, and it became a significant issue for the alliance on Sept. 11, 2001, said Lisa Sawyer Samp, a senior fellow in the international security program of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "\"NATO invoked Article 5, its collective defense provision, the day after the 9/11 attacks and has focused on dealing with this threat ever since, including most importantly by deploying troops for the past 12 years in Afghanistan,\" said Ivo H. Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs who previously served as Ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama.",
      "At its peak, NATO and its partners sent about 40,000 troops to Afghanistan, Benitez said, and this year, there are still about 4,000 troops from NATO allies in Afghanistan.",
      "\"It is impossible to argue that NATO has not played an overwhelmingly important role in the war on terror,\" said Timothy Andrews Sayle, an assistant professor of modern global security at the University of Toronto.",
      "It's worth noting that, according to experts, NATO's structure and role has made it an imperfect vehicle for counter-terrorism. \"Allied warfare is exceptionally difficult and fraught with problems of coordination and compatibility,\" Sayle said. Intelligence sharing has been especially challenging -- a shortcoming that the new position was designed to ease.",
      "NATO's post-9/11 terrorism blueprint did undergo one major overhaul -- but that occurred in 2012, several years before Trump started running for president. The overhaul, as announced at a summit in Wales, states that \"the Alliance strives at all times to remain aware of the evolving threat from terrorism; to ensure it has adequate capabilities to prevent, protect against, and respond to terrorist threats.\"",
      "\"So it took about a decade to update the initial post-9/11 framework for dealing with terrorism,\" said Matthew Fay, a defense policy analyst with the Niskanen Center.",
      "Did Trump have anything to do with it?",
      "Despite Trump's desire for credit, this is the part where his statement goes off the rails. Trump strongly implies that NATO acted because of his concerns. But experts agree that nothing of the sort happened.",
      "For starters, experts said, leaders of the NATO countries feel little warmth for Trump, suggesting that they wouldn't do anything to bolster his prospects of becoming president.",
      "\"It is comical to suggest NATO would change its counterterrorism policy in response to anything Donald Trump has said about it over the course of his campaign,\" Fay said. \"Like his claim that he was against the invasion of Iraq, this is another reflection of the Republican nominee living in a foreign policy world of his own creation.\"",
      "Even more important are the structural obstacles -- namely, that an alliance as broad as NATO tends to take longer to get all its members to sign off on strategic changes.",
      "\"This is almost certainly just an odd coincidence,\" Sayle said. \"The position would be the result of a very long slog by those who have favored the idea against those who may believe the alliance too large and diffuse to be effective or safe for sharing detailed intelligence.\"",
      "Saideman agreed. \"NATO never works fast on anything, and most of the major changes are timed to be announced at summits like the Warsaw Summit or smaller meetings where defense ministers and foreign ministers meet.\"",
      "Finally, NATO rejected the notion that Trump had anything to do with the change in a statement to Politico.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said, \"I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism. Since my comments, they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats.\"",
      "The change he's apparently referring to -- the creation of a new senior post and division for coordinating intelligence sharing -- is just the most recent incremental change in how the alliance handles counter-terrorism, a topic it has addressed, in big ways and small, for more than 30 years. There is no evidence that the change was made in response to Trump's complaints about the alliance. Experts said such changes typically require a longer gestation period so that all member nations can get on board. We rate Trump's statement False.",

      "Back in January, Iran released five American prisoners back to the United States. On the same day, the United States transferred $400 million in cash to Iran, holding onto the money until three of the freed Americans were in the air, on their way home.",
      "Some critics of President Barack Obama's foreign policy -- including Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump -- are putting the two happenings together and calling it a \"ransom\" payment. The administration denies that characterization.",
      "\"Iran, the world's top state sponsor of terrorism, has been put on the path to nuclear weapons, was given $400 million in ransom payment cash, where they just yesterday caught Obama in yet another lie,\" Trump said in an Aug. 21 speech in Michigan.",
      "While some in the national security community might consider the transaction unsavory, ineffectual, or legally questionable, calling it \"ransom\" isn't quite accurate.",
      "The word \"ransom\" implies that Iran refused to release the prisoners unless the United States turned over $400 million of its own money to Iran, and American officials capitulated.",
      "In reality, the United States owed Iran $400 million as part of a longstanding dispute, and negotiators used that pending settlement as leverage to release the detained Americans. Experts said this kind of exchange is standard issue in U.S.-Iran relations over the past few decades.",
      "The important but subtle nuance is this: While settling the $400 million helped ensure that the prisoners got home, it wasn't an illicit payment. Iran, according to the claim adjudicators, had a legitimate right to the money.",
      "Business as usual'",
      "In 1979, Iran's then-monarch Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi paid $400 million to the United States government to purchase military parts. But that year's revolution toppled the shah, and the military parts were never delivered.",
      "To regain its funds, Iran filed a claim against the United States in 1981 in the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, which adjudicates disputes between the two nations. The body, located at the Hague, was established amid negotiations to end the 1979-81 Iran hostage crisis, in which pro-revolution students took over the U.S. embassy in Tehran.",
      "The tribunal's first priority was to address claims from private individuals, including 4,700 now-resolved U.S. claims filed against the Government of Iran. Over the past several years, the tribunal has focused more of its attention on claims the two governments have made against each other, including this dispute over the $400 million weapons deal.",
      "The State Department announced its settlement in the dispute the United States would pay Iran $400 million plus $1.3 billion in interest on Jan. 17, the same day Obama announced the return of the Americans detained in Iran, as well as the formal implementation of the nuclear deal. The first installment of the settlement was also transferred that day, via an unmarked cargo plane, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal in early August.",
      "The administration paid the funds using various European currencies because U.S. law bars financial transactions with Iran in U.S. dollars, and Iran's access to banking is limited because of international sanctions.",
      "The administration has explained that the $400 million settlement and the prisoner release were negotiated in separate channels and coincidentally reached their resolutions near the same time. Negotiators took advantage of the convergence in order to ensure that Iran returned the prisoners by withholding the payment until the American detainees were in the air and headed out of Iran.",
      "\"While there is no connection between the $400 million and the return of our American citizens, we did, however, in those endgame hours, hold back that payment until we knew that our Americans were safe and sound and on their way out of Iran, because, in the very last few hours, Iran was playing a few games here on us,\" said State Department spokesman John Kirby in an Aug. 19 PBS interview.",
      "We may never truly know how intertwined these two negotiation channels were, but two experts personally familiar with the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal told us that the administration's explanation is plausible.",
      "\"As for the timing of this particular settlement, the Obama administration's account is entirely consistent with my experience,\" said Nancy Combs, who was a legal adviser to the tribunal until becoming a professor at William and Mary Law School in 2004.",
      "Combs said this particular claim was massive in size, complexity and value, so it is likely that lawyers had been working on this case prior to and separate from the prisoner issue, as well as the nuclear deal talks.",
      "Given that these cases are hashed out by career lawyers over many years, it's likely that the lawyers approached the administration with the news that they were in a position to settle, as opposed to the administration directing them to settle, said John Bellinger, who served as the State Department's chief legal adviser under President George W. Bush. (Bellinger has publicly opposed Trump.)",
      "\"I suspect that these two negotiations, the claims settlement and detained persons, were completely separate and happened to come together at the same time,\" Bellinger added. \"I don't think it's appropriate to call this ransom, and the intent of the money was not to gain the return of these detainees.\"",
      "We should note that some have pointed out an article Bellinger wrote for the Washington Post in 2009, in which he seemed to say the tribunal had already dismissed this claim. Bellinger told us that it is his understanding that the January 2016 settlement involved a different dispute.",
      "We talked to five people who study national security and Iran. The only one willing to call the payment \"ransom\" was Clare Lopez, vice president for research and analysis at the Center for Security Policy, a right-leaning think tank. Lopez has called the broader Iran deal unconstitutional and has written for conservative websites.",
      "\"There's simply no other way to call an unmarked cargo plane delivery of pallets of shrink-wrapped European currency in the middle of the night to the foremost state sponsor of terror in the world that remains under U.S. financial sanctions for terrorism,\" Lopez said.",
      "The majority of experts said the ransom label was inaccurate.",
      "\"In no sense can this payment be considered ransom,\" Combs said. \"A ransom is a payment made to secure the release of a detained person. This sum, by contrast, was made to satisfy a legitimate debt that the U.S. owed to Iran.\"",
      "Gary Samore, executive director for research at Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and a former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction under Obama, said it's not \"technically ransom in that the money that was returned was Iran's money.\"",
      "Samore said he was not surprised by the exchange because there's a history of using financial tools to settle deals with Iran. He specifically noted that in 2011, the nation of Oman paid Iran $1 million on the United States' behalf for the release of two American hikers who had been jailed in Iran for two years.",
      "\"It's business as usual,\" he said. \"I don't think the Iranians are going to release prisoners if they don't get something.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said the Obama administration gave Iran \"$400 million in ransom payment cash.\"",
      "On the same day in January, the United States paid Iran $400 million dollars, and Iran released several American prisoners. While there appears to be a quid pro quo the United States would not give Iran the cash until the prisoners were on their way home this does not equate to ransom, experts told us.",
      "Iran had a legitimate claim to the money, as the United States owed it to Iran as part of a resolution to a decades-long financial dispute. It's unclear whether the prisoner and financial disputes were connected in just the final hours of the prisoner transfer or if there was more advance coordination.",

      "Priebus took a swing at Hillary Clinton's past, telling NBC's Meet the Press host Chuck Todd that her actions say a lot about her, adding \"she's the one that labeled African-American youth as superpredators'.\"",
      "Trump, who is looking to increase his appeal among African-American voters, made the same \"superpredator\" claim days earlier on Twitter.",
      "",
      "It didn't take long to find what Trump and Priebus were referencing, but for this fact-check, we wanted to take a close look at the full context of Clinton's remark.",
      "Superpredators' in context",
      "The \"superpredators\" line comes from a 1996 speech in New Hampshire, where Clinton spoke in support of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which her husband, Bill Clinton, had signed in to law.",
      "\"We're making some progress,\" Clinton said. \"Much of it is related to the initiative called community policing.' Because we have finally gotten more police officers on the street. That was one of the goals that the president had when he pushed the crime bill that was passed in 1994.\"",
      "Provisions of the act included a ban on some assault weapons, more funding for community policing and an expansion of the death penalty. The legislation, which was championed by Bill Clinton as a way to reduce the number of African-Americans being killed in drug-related incidents, has drawn criticism in recent years for sending disproportionate numbers of African-Americans to prison.",
      "The \"superpredator\" remark, which Priebus and Trump referenced, was in the same speech a few lines later.",
      "\"But we also have to have an organized effort against gangs,\" Hillary Clinton said in a C-SPAN video clip. \"Just as in a previous generation we had an organized effort against the mob. We need to take these people on. They are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called superpredators no conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first, we have to bring them to heel.\"",
      "The full context of this incident does link children and superpredators, but nowhere in the speech does she directly label African-American youth this way.",
      "However, backlash from this speech has followed Clinton into this year's election. Two Black Lives Matter activists confronted Clinton at a private fundraiser in February, telling the candidate she owes black people an apology.",
      "One day after this confrontation, Clinton released a statement to the Washington Post's Jonathan Capehart, expressing regret for her word choice.",
      "\"Looking back, I shouldn't have used those words, and I wouldn't use them today,\" she said.",
      "Later in the election cycle, former Democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders, also criticized her language at a debate in Brooklyn. When Sanders was asked by debate moderator why he called out Bill Clinton out for his defense of Clinton's use of the term \"superpredator,\" Sanders responded, \"Because it was a racist term, and everyone knew it was a racist term.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Priebus said Hillary Clinton is \"the the one that labeled African-American youth as superpredators.\"",
      "Clinton in the midst of championing her husband's 1994 crime legislation did use the term \"superpredator\" when referring to \"gangs of kids.\" She did not specifically label superpredators as African-American, but the context of her speech and her subsequent apology decades later suggests it was a reasonable inference.",

According to Time's calculations, the counties where Clinton gained ground on Obama had a median of 75,554 voters in 2016. The comparable figure for the counties where Trump exceeded Romney's performance was 9,905 voters. So the median Clinton-trending county was more than seven times bigger than the median Trump-trending county.",

Clinton's comparatively tiny number of counties \"encompassed a massive 64 percent of America's economic activity,\" compared to 36 percent for Trump's much larger stable of counties. Here's a graphical representation of what they found, with Clinton counties in blue and Trump counties in red, and each county's rectangle scaled to the size of the output in that county:",
      "",
      "\"Here you can see very clearly that with the exceptions of the Phoenix and Fort Worth areas and a big chunk of Long Island, Clinton won every large-sized county economy in the country,\" the authors wrote. \"Trumpland consists of hundreds and hundreds of tiny low-output locations that comprise the non-metropolitan hinterland of America, along with some suburban and exurban metro counties.\"",
      "All of this illustrates a general pattern for Democrats in recent election cycles: They have run strongly in populous and economically growing urban and suburban areas, but poorly in lightly populated rural areas. This has been true for the entire period we're looking at -- in fact, Bill Clinton never managed to win more counties during his two victories in the 1990s -- but the partisan disparity has been growing steadily. And the pattern reached a new apogee with the Trump vs. Clinton race.",

      "\"Loving County, Texas, has a population of 82, while California's Los Angeles County has over 9.8 million,\" said Costas Panagopoulos, a Fordham University political scientist. \"The number of counties won is not necessarily a meaningful indicator, absent any consideration of the population of these counties.\"",
      "Seth Masket, a University of Denver political scientist, agreed.",
      "\"Partisanship increasingly correlates with urbanism,\" he said. \"There are a lot more rural counties than urban ones, so I'd expect Republicans to be winning more and more counties over time. So the claim that the GOP is winning more counties is possibly an interesting reflection on residential living patterns, but it doesn't really reflect what the voters wanted or what the government has a mandate to address.\"",

By contrast, Trump's electoral vote haul was bigger than only five elections in the post-World War II era (1960, 1968, 1976, 2000 and 2004). So Trump ranks in the bottom one-third by this metric.",

      "While there have been four previous occasions when a presidential candidate lost the Electoral College vote while winning the popular vote, Clinton's margin of victory is notably large.",

The tower would, in part, supply water for hydraulic fracturing which injects pressurized water as well as sand and chemicals under shale rock formations to extract natural gas.",

      "\"Furthermore, upon information and belief, (the Bartonville Water Supply Corporation) will sell water to oil and gas explorers for fracing shale formations leading to traffic with heavy trucks on FM 407, creating a noise nuisance and traffic hazards,\" it continues.",
      "In addition to joining the lawsuit, Tillerson sat for a three-hour deposition in May 2013 and protested the project at a town council meeting that November, according to the Journal's report in February 2014. But the newspaper noted that Tillerson wasn't \"the most vocal or well-known opponent of the tower.\" That distinction belonged to the lead plaintiffs, former U.S. House Majority Leader Dick Armey and his wife.",

      "Contributions",
      "Trump's campaign brought in about $19.4 million by the end of 2015. Trump contributed nearly $13 million of that himself. Most of the remainder comes from individual contributions, which federal law caps at $2,700 per candidate per election.",

Jeb Bush at $388,720.",
      "Although a significant portion of his campaign funds, about 34 percent, come from individual contributions, Trump doesn't appear to be actively soliciting these donations with high-profile fundraising events. The Sunlight Foundation, which advocates for transparency in money in politics, tracks political fundraisers with its Political Party Time tool. It has no record of any events to benefit Trump.",

      "It's worth noting a couple more caveats. First, Trump's self-financing only really picked up in the last three months of 2015. From the start of his campaign in April through October last year, individual contributions made up about 67 percent of total money raised for his campaign.",
      "Other media outlets who looked at this claim before the most recent FEC filings concluded that Trump's claim was inaccurate because, at the time, most of his funding was coming from individual contributions.",
      "But in the last quarter, Trump gave his campaign a $10.8 million loan, turning that balance around.",
      "That brings us to the second caveat: The vast majority of Trump's contributions to his own campaign about $12.6 million are loans rather than donations. This means he could expect to eventually recoup these funds.",
      "Further, of the approximately $12 million Trump's campaign spent in 2015, about $2.7 million went toward reimbursing Trump-affiliated companies for services provided to the campaign, such as traveling in his own plane and helicopter, according to a New York Times analysis.",
      "On whether Trump should describe his campaign as self-funded, given these caveats, it's \"sort of a judgment call,\" said Viveca Novak, editorial and communications director at the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics.",
      "\"To me, it would be more accurate to say he was partially self-funding,' \" Novak added.",
      "Trump's claim is accurate in part, but it needs a big asterisk, said Richard Skinner, a policy analyst at the Sunlight Foundation.",
      "He added that all self-funders take at least some individual contributions, noting in particular former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney's 2008 primary run. Romney provided about 44 percent of his campaign's total funds raised, while about 56 percent came from individual donations.",
      "Rick Hasen, an expert in election and campaign finance law at the University of California Irvine, disagrees.",
      "\"I don't think it is fair to say that a person is self-funding if a significant share of those contributions come from someone other than the candidate,\" he said. \"Nor do I think a candidate who loans money to his campaign, but who expects to be paid back by the campaign, is fairly characterized as self-funding.\"",
      "It's possible that Trump's intent to self-fund his campaign could result in a president that feels less indebted to billionaires' special interests, as Trump claims, Skinner noted. But even if he isn't taking their money, they still might have influence on Trump.",
      "\"One critique of fundraising, it makes you spend a lot of time around very rich people, and Trump clearly already does that,\" Skinner said.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said, \"I'm self-funding my own campaign.\"",
      "As of the end of 2015, Trump's own contributions account for more than half of all money the campaign has taken in. He's contributed far more of his own money than any other candidate this cycle.",
      "However, a significant portion of his money comes from individual contributions. For several months last year, the campaign received far more dollars from potential voters than they did from Trump. Additionally, most of Trump's contributions have been loans rather than donations, so he may hope to recoup those funds.",
      "The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True."

      "During his victory speech after the New Hampshire primary, Donald Trump repeated a claim he'd made several times before.",
      "\"Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment,\" Trump said. \"The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.\"",
      "Actually, Trump's the one who shouldn't be believed. Numbers that high are not even close to accurate.",
      "To understand why, let's start by discussing how the official unemployment rate is calculated.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a federal agency, uses surveys and statistical sampling to calculate how many Americans do or don't work. To calculate the unemployment rate, the agency divides the number of people who are out of work (counting only those who have recently looked for work) by the sum of the job-seeking and job-holding population.",
      "During the most recent month -- January 2016 -- the unemployment rate was 4.9 percent, its lowest level since February 2008.",
      "Not factored into this calculation, however, are people who are not currently looking for work. This is a longstanding concern for economists, because at least some of those people who aren't looking for work right now might prefer to be looking for work but don't feel they have a shot in the current job market.",
      "To ease such concerns, the bureau also produces a statistic with a more expansive definition of what it calls \"labor underutilization.\" This statistic is known by the wonky shorthand \"U-6.\"",
      "The U-6 rate includes both those who are officially \"unemployed\" and those who are working part time for economic reasons and those who are \"marginally attached\" to the work force, meaning they want to work but have not looked for work recently enough to count as being actively in the labor force.",
      "Currently the U-6 rate is 9.9 percent, about double the official unemployment rate. But that's also its lowest level since May 2008.",
      "It's possible to argue that the U-6 rate offers a fairer way of encapsulating the unemployment picture; some mainstream economists are sympathetic to that argument.",
      "But where Trump goes off the rails is in suggesting that the \"real\" unemployment rate is somewhere between 28 percent and 42 percent.",
      "Why? He's including a ton of Americans not expected to be working. Let's explore this point further.",
      "The source of Trump's 42 percent figure appears to be a column by David Stockman, who served as President Ronald Reagan's budget director.",
      "Stockman calculated that there are currently 210 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 68 -- what he calls a \"plausible measure of the potential workforce.\" If you assume that each of those people is able to hold down a full-time job, he wrote, they would offer a total of 420 billion potential working hours. However, during 2014, Stockman noted, only 240 billion working hours were actually recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "If you run the numbers, \"the real unemployment rate was 42.9 percent,\" Stockman wrote.",
      "Economists say Stockman's way of looking at the question -- using actual hours worked divided by a theoretical maximum that could have been worked, rather than determining whether individual people are employed or unemployed -- is provocative. But they say this raw measurement has serious flaws.",
      "Indeed, in his column, Stockman acknowledges that this figure is imperfect, even though his tone is flip when he does so.",
      "\"Yes, we have to allow for non-working wives, students, the disabled, early retirees and coupon clippers,\" he wrote. \"We also have drifters, grifters, welfare cheats, bums and people between jobs, enrolled in training programs, on sabbaticals and much else.\"",
      "Snark aside, economists say this caveat is crucial.",
      "Stockman's calculation \"treats people voluntarily working part-time hours as partly unemployed, even if they have excellent reasons for wanting to hold only a part-time job, such as rearing children, attending school or college, being disabled, or transitioning into retirement,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. \"A lot of the shortfall between full-time and part-time employment is perfectly reasonable, as is a potential worker's decision not to work or look for paid work at all.\"",
      "In other words, Trump's faith in the accuracy of the 42 percent figure is misplaced.",
      "So is there a plausible calculation that can get us to 42 percent? The short answer is no.",
      "To see why, let's start with the number of Americans age 16 and up who are not either (1) employed, (2) unemployed, (3) in the military or (4) institutionalized. That gives us 94 million \"non-working\" Americans.",
      "We then subtracted the number of people who have good reasons not to be working or looking for work.",
      "People age 16 to 19 who are not in the labor force: Subtract 10.8 million",
      "People age 65 and up who are not in the labor force: Subtract 38.4 million",
      "Students, age 20-24: Subtract 8.7 million",
      "Students, age 25-29: Subtract 2.9 million",
      "Students, age 30-34: Subtract 1.4 million",
      "Stay-at-home moms: Subtract 10.4 million",
      "Stay at-home dads: Subtract 2 million",
      "Those receiving disability checks: Subtract 8.9 million",
      "So what remains? By this calculation, there are 10.5 million Americans who do not have obvious reasons for not working.",
      "If you were to use these numbers to create a new type of \"unemployment\" rate -- call it \"U-7\" if you like -- it would come out to 15.6 percent. That's higher than the U-6 rate of 9.9 percent, but it's only a fraction of the 42 percent Trump claimed.",
      "This isn't a perfect calculation. There's probably some double-counting, and there could be good reasons why some of those 10.5 million Americans aren't working, such as being a full-time student between the ages of 34 and 65, undergoing job training, or being affluent enough to be able to forgo work or retire early. Some might argue that students shouldn't get off so easy because they should be able to handle a job along with their studies, or that we should set a higher retirement-age cutoff than 65.",
      "Quibble with the numbers if you like, but this is a solid enough back-of-the envelope calculation to show how wildly inaccurate Trump's claim is. And remember, we are deliberately stretching the numbers here as an intellectual exercise; we are not saying that 15.6 percent is a more accurate unemployment rate than the official one of 4.9 percent.",
      "There's even a silver lining to the current state of affairs, Burtless said. Most of those suffering from being \"out of work\" by Trump's definition can actually be seen as benefiting from their membership in an affluent, technologically advanced society.",
      "The fact that millions of adults are what Trump would term \"jobless,\" he said, \"is not a marker of economic failure -- it is an indicator of a very prosperous society that can afford to permit the old and disabled to retire, that can invest in young adults so they can improve their skills, and that can keep some adults in the home where they can care for children or attend to other non-paying pursuits.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said, \"Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.\"",
      "While economists say that there are other, more expansive calculations of unemployment or under-employment, none of the official ones are currently higher than 9.9 percent, and the highest credible number we could calculate was 15.6 percent. That's far, far lower than 42 percent -- or even 28 percent. We rate the claim Pants on Fire."

      "In one of the most heated and personal back-and-forths from a debate this cycle, Donald Trump eviscerated former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for supporting his brother's decision to invade Iraq in 2003.",
      "Trump stood by his comment in 2008 that Democrats should have impeached President George W. Bush over the invasion when asked about it in the Feb. 13 CBS debate in South Carolina. Trump vigorously refuted Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio's statements hailing the former president's leadership, saying, \"The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush. He kept us safe? That is not safe.\"",
      "Again, Trump said he was against the war from the very beginning.",
      "\"I'm the only one on this stage that said, Do not go into Iraq. Do not attack Iraq,' \" Trump said. \"Nobody else on this stage said that. And I said it loud and strong. And I was in the private sector. I wasn't a politician, fortunately. But I said it, and I said it loud and clear, You'll destabilize the Middle East.' \"",
      "Trump often repeats this line, and we've rated a similar Trump claim Mostly False, because he didn't appear to take any public position on the war until after the March 2003 invasion. In this more recent version of the statement, he also said he stated his opposition to the war \"loud and clear.\" But the public record of his positions is thin.",
      "Let's revisit the facts.",
      "We searched newspaper articles and television transcripts from 2002 and 2003, during the debate leading up to the Iraq War. We didn't find any examples of Trump unequivocally denouncing the war until a year after the war began.",
      "Trump's comments",
      "We only found one instance where Trump discussed the war before it started. On Jan. 28, 2003, just under three months before the invasion, Fox News' Neil Cavuto asked Trump whether President Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy.",
      "Speaking of Iraq, Trump said, \"Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.\"",
      "Trump seems to be skeptical of the mission in Iraq here, and he said the economy should be a higher priority. But he did not say anything that resembles his claim that Bush should not proceed because a war would \"destabilize the Middle East.\"",
      "A single, squishy comment about the looming war does not qualify as \"loud and clear\" opposition.",
      "The United States invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003.",
      "A week later Trump gave differing takes. At an Academy Awards after-party, Trump said that \"the war's a mess,\" according to the Washington Post. He told Fox News that because of the war, \"The market's going to go up like a rocket.\"",
      "Trump's harshest criticism came more than a year into the war, in an August 2004 article in Esquire:",
      "\"Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over. And he'll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam didn't have.",

All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!\"",
      "He told CNN's Larry King in November 2004, \"I do not believe that we made the right decision going into Iraq, but, you know, hopefully, we'll be getting out.\"",

      "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump raised eyebrows during a recent rally when he offered a counterinsurgency parable from more than a century ago that featured United States Army Gen. John Joseph \"Black Jack\" Pershing.",
      "During a Feb. 19, 2016, rally in North Charleston, S.C., Trump referred to an anecdote from the aftermath of the Philippine-American War of 1899-1902, when the United States sought to exert its authority over the Asian archipelago, which it had recently obtained from Spain after winning the Spanish-American War.",
      "Help PolitiFact raise $15,000 to hire a fact-checker to cover the immigration debate.",
      "After taking the reins of power from Spain, the United States faced armed opposition, and the three-year war led to the deaths of more than 4,200 American combatants, more than 20,000 Filipino combatants, and as many as 200,000 Filipino civilians, according to the State Department.",
      "After the war, Pershing served as governor of the heavily Muslim Moro Province between 1909 and 1913. This period was notable for its continuing insurgencies.",
      "\"They were having terrorism problems, just like we do,\" Trump said, according to an account in the Washington Post. \"And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs' blood you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem.\"",
      "After Trump told this story, critics called it apocryphal, misleading or outright false. Our friends at Snopes.com considered the evidence and called it a \"legend.\"",
      "We decided to check with historians of the period to see what they thought of the story. We heard back from eight scholars. Most expressed skepticism that the specific story ever happened, and many added that Trump's takeaway is wrong-headed. We'll take a look at those two concerns separately below.",
      "Did it happen?",
      "The idea that pig's blood could serve as a weapon against Muslims has been around in popular culture for decades.",
      "For instance, a 1939 Hollywood movie, The Real Glory, stars Gary Cooper as a doctor on the Philippine island of Mindanao who drapes a captive in pigskin \"to serve as an abject lesson to all would-be attackers,\" Luis H. Francia, a Filipino-born professor of Asian American Studies at Hunter College, wrote recently.",
      "Snopes has been tracking Internet-based rumors of this sort since 2001, and a California National Guard facility removed a poster telling the Pershing story in 2005.",
      "But the only historical evidence that something like this actually happened appears to come from a letter written by a soldier who served in the Philippines.",
      "\"Mr. C.C. Booth of Dallas, Texas, who served in Mindanao under Pershing, recalls seeing him hang a Moro chieftain by the heels over an open grave, kill a pig, and then drop the Moro into the grave with the bloody animal,\" according to a 1962 article by Donald Smythe in the Pacific Historical Review, an academic journal.",
      "However, David J. Silbey, a Cornell University historian and author of A War of Frontier and Empire: The Philippine-American War, 1899-1902, raised red flags about its sourcing. This claim came from one letter -- and one that was written in 1960, more than half a century after the events in question. (And for the sake of this fact-check, the details differ significantly from the story Trump told.)",
      "Other historians agreed that the evidence is thin, to say the least.",
      "\"This story is a fabrication and has long been discredited,\" said Brian McAllister Linn, a Texas A&M University historian and author of Guardians of Empire: The U.S. Army and the Pacific, 1902-1940. \"I am amazed it is still making the rounds.\"",
      "Christopher Einolf, a professor at DePaul University and author of America in the Philippines, 1899-1902: The First Torture Scandal, added that he trusted the conclusion of the late military historian Frank E. Vandiver, who told About.com in 2003 that \"I never found any indication that it was true in extensive research on his Moro experiences. This kind of thing would have run completely against his character.\"",
      "Indeed, other historians noted that Pershing pursued a less brutal approach to \"pacifying\" the rebels in the southern Philippines than Leonard Wood, one of his predecessors.",
      "\"He did a lot of what we would call winning hearts and minds' and embraced reforms which helped end their resistance,\" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. \"He fought too, but only when he had to, and only against tribes or bands that just wouldn't negotiate with him. He wasn't solely committed to fighting as people like Trump who tell the pig blood story imply.\"",
      "Another wrinkle: Historians said the premise that the rebels would have been motivated by a fear of pigs is not as certain as Trump suggests. It's unclear how religiously observant the insurgents were and whether such a policy would have made a difference in their actions.",
      "\"The Moros were fighting for a lot of reasons, not just because they were Muslims,\" Janda said. \"This is another fact that gets lost in many modern discussions of terrorism.\"",
      "Facts aside, Trump's larger point is wrong",
      "To many of the historians we checked with, the idea that Pershing's hypothetical blood-dipped bullets pacified \"terrorists\" is actually the bigger problem with Trump's parable.",
      "\"Even if the tale is true, the pacifying effect that Trump claims is nonsense,\" said Michael H. Hunt, an emeritus historian at the University of North Carolina and author of Arc of Empire: America's Wars in Asia from the Philippines to Vietnam. The region \"remained in constant unrest during the period of American rule and into the period of independence, right down to the present.\"",
      "Silbey of Cornell agreed. \"Where Trump's remark becomes ridiculous is in the idea that this actually worked,\" he said. \"The Moro War did not end until 1913, and even that's a bit of a soft date, with violence continuing for quite a while afterward. Defilement by pig's blood isn't -- and wasn't -- some magical method of ending terrorism.\"",
      "If anything, a more complete account of the Moro insurgency involves some subplots that run contrary to Trump's narrative.",
      "\"The Ottomans under Sultan Abdul Hamid II sent a letter to the Sulu Moros asking them not to resist the Americans at the start of the Moro Rebellion, and the Moros on Sulu complied,\" Janda said. \"It's a nice example of diplomacy working to our advantage, and a reminder that then and now, not all Muslims or Moros are the same and that many were and are U.S. allies.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Of the eight historians we checked with, all were at least skeptical that what Trump said actually happened, and some expressed disbelief even more forcefully than that. The only evidence of something approximating what Trump said stems from one letter documenting a different scenario written by a veteran more than a half century after the fact.",
      "Perhaps more important, the historians took issue with Trump's suggestion that the tactic -- if it was even used at all -- actually worked to end tensions, noting that unrest persisted for years. In all, Trump's claim is ridiculous, so we rate it Pants on Fire.",
      "UPDATE, Feb. 29, 2016: After we published this story, a reader pointed us to a memoir by Pershing titled My Life Before the World War, 1860-1917, which was republished in 2013 by the University Press of Kentucky. In the memoir, Pershing writes that another commanding officer in the Philippines, Col. Frank West, had in at least one case seen to it that bodies of Muslim insurgents \"were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig. It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins.\"",
      "In a footnote, the editor of the 2013 edition, John T. Greenwood, cited a letter about the incident from Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell, the commander of the Philippines Division, to Pershing: \"Of course there is nothing to be done, but I understand it has long been a custom to bury (insurgents) with pigs when they kill Americans. I think this a good plan, for if anything will discourage the (insurgents) it is the prospect of going to hell instead of to heaven. You can rely on me to stand by you in maintaining this custom. It is the only possible thing we can do to discourage crazy fanatics.\"",

The contractor signed on workers from a local union and, to meet Trump's tight deadline, also brought on 200 undocumented laborers from Poland dubbed the \"Polish Brigade.\"",

      "The question plays out against a stark statistic although African-Americans make up 13 percent of the general population, they account for 36 percent of the inmate population, according to the latest data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics.",
      "Risk of arrest",
      "A heap of evidence shows African-Americans are arrested at higher rates.",
      "The Clinton campaign pointed out a Washington Post blog post (referring to a Brookings Institution piece) that said blacks are 3.6 times more likely to be arrested for selling drugs than whites even though whites are 45 percent more likely to sell drugs than blacks. But the data is from 1980, part of a paper that talks about drug dealing and legitimate self-employment.",
      "The campaign also had fresher data in mind, however, including a USA Today analysis of arrest rates around the country in the wake of the racial unrest in Ferguson, Mo. In at least 1,581 of 3,538 police departments, the paper found, blacks were even more likely to be arrested than in Ferguson. Only 173 departments \"arrested black people at a rate equal to or lower than other racial groups,\" the paper reported.",
      "The Bureau of Justice Statistics periodically surveys the public to study police-citizen interactions. Its most recent report in 2008 found that white, black and Hispanic drivers were stopped at similar rates by police. However, black drivers were about three times as likely as white drivers to be searched during a traffic stop. (When a search occurred, evidence was found in only 8.4 percent of the cases, but the report doesn't break that down by race.)",
      "The Sentencing Project, an advocacy group, has looked at that breakdown using 2013 profiling data posted in 2014 by Missouri's attorney general's office. It found that when a white driver was stopped in Ferguson, there was a 7 percent chance the car would be searched and a 34 percent chance that something would be found. But when a black driver was stopped, the search rate was significantly higher 12 percent and the odds of actually finding contraband were significantly lower (22 percent).",
      "Not only that, blacks were twice as likely as whites to be arrested during a traffic stop.",
      "In a spot check, we found similar patterns in Jefferson City.",
      "It's not just traffic stops. According to a National Research Council report, drug arrest rates have long been higher for blacks, even though data show that blacks are generally no more likely to use drugs than whites and there's little evidence that they sell drugs more often than whites.",
      "",
      "What surveys have shown \"is that the levels of self-reported drug sales are about the same for blacks and whites, especially under age 20,\" said Michael Tonry, professor of law at the University of Minnesota. \"But the big differences are that whites are more likely to sell to people they know, and they much more often sell behind closed doors. Blacks sell to people they don't know and in public, which makes them vastly easier to arrest.\"",
      "Sentencing",
      "There is also evidence for Clinton's statement that blacks are more likely to get a stiffer sentence than a white person who has been convicted of the same crime and has the same criminal history.",
      "Studies have shown, for instance, that when prosecutors are deciding on what charges to file against suspects, they tend to select more severe charges for blacks and to use habitual offender laws against blacks more than whites under similar circumstances, particularly when it comes to drug and property crimes, according to a Florida study reported in the journal Criminology.",
      "A 2013 study in the Yale Law Journal reported that black men were nearly twice as likely to be charged with an offense that carried a mandatory minimum sentence than white men facing similar circumstances. When judges have discretion over how long a sentence should be for a specific crime, they tend to select longer sentences for blacks even if they have the same criminal history.",
      "After controlling for the arrest offense, a person's criminal history and other characteristics, sentences for black males were about 10 percent higher than for whites, the study found.",
      "The problem is that as cases work their way through the various steps of the criminal justice system, the degree of the disparity \"accumulates at each level,\" said Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a research analyst at the Sentencing Project.",
      "\"You're a little bit more likely to get arrested if you're a person of color than if you're white. You're a little bit more likely to have a higher bail amount to be released. That's going to make it harder for you to get released. You're a little more likely to get a worse plea deal offer,\" she said. \"As you go through the system, each individual stage makes some small contribution to the overall disparity that we see. But it's going to be significant as you go through the stages.\"",
      "Tonry of the University of Minnesota agreed that sentences are longer for blacks generally, but \"it depends hugely on what crime you're talking about.",
      "\"If it's a drug crime that's affected by mandatory minimums, it's vastly longer,\" Tonry said. \"If you're talking about things not subject to mandatory minimums, on average, across the board, blacks probably get sentences that are 5 percent or 10 percent longer than whites do.\"",
      "How much of this is due to racism is a matter of debate. The experts say poverty may play a major role, but it can be hard to separate the two. The best studies try to adjust for the fact that minorities tend to be concentrated in poorer areas, where crime tends to be higher and there's a greater demand for police. That can skew the numbers.",
      "And sentences can be longer for poor people under pressure to cop a plea because they can't afford bail or a good lawyer.",

      "In a new television ad -- his campaign's first -- Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump shows footage of dozens of people swarming over a border fence. But the footage isn't as it seems.",
      "About halfway through the ad, a narrator says of Trump, \"He'll stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border that Mexico will pay for.\" Video footage shows dozens of people streaming across the border, as if they were ants fleeing an anthill.",
      "",
      "The clear suggestion is that the footage is of the \"southern border\" between the United States and Mexico. But it's not -- it's 5,000 miles away, in a small Spanish enclave on the mainland of Morocco.",
      "PolitiFact was able to trace the footage back to the Italian television network RepubblicaTV. On May 3, 2014, the network posted footage of migrants crossing the border into Melilla, one of two enclaves on the Moroccan coast that are held by Spain. Migrants who cross the border there are essentially entering territory held by a European Union nation, even though they are still on the African continent. (It can also be seen posted by a YouTube user here.)",
      "",
      "The RepubblicaTV video is time-stamped May 1, 2014. According to the description posted by the network (and using Google Translate) the video was released by the Interior Ministry in Madrid, showing an \"onslaught of hundreds of migrants to the wall that separates the Spanish enclave of Melilla from Morocco. About 800 tried to cross the border on May 1st. Those who failed to escape the control of the Civil Guard were hanging on the barriers for six hours before being rejected.\"",
      "The 2014 RepubblicaTV video resurfaced a year later, in a July 2015 YouTube post titled, \"1,000s of immigrants try to cross the border at once.\" It makes no reference to the location.",
      "By the time the footage made it into Trump's ad, both RepubblicaTV's logo and the 2014 time stamp were no longer visible.",
      "Regardless of Trump's imagery, the Pew Research Center noted last month that \"for the first time since the 1940s, more immigrants from Mexico are leaving the U.S. than coming into the country. The shift is due to several reasons, including slow economic recovery after the Great Recession that may have made the U.S. less attractive, as well as stricter enforcement of U.S. immigration laws, particularly at the border.\"",

      "Hitting the campaign trail on her mother's behalf, Chelsea Clinton attacked Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders' universal health care plan.",
      "\"Sen. Sanders wants to dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the CHIP program, dismantle Medicare, and dismantle private insurance,\" Clinton said in New Hampshire Jan. 12. \"I don't want to empower Republican governors to take away Medicaid, to take away health insurance for low-income and middle-income working Americans. And I think very much that's what Sen. Sanders' plan would do.\"",
      "The Sanders campaign and his supporters swiftly called Clinton's statements inaccurate, so we decided to look into them ourselves in particular, her claim that Sanders' plan would \"empower\" governors \"to take away health insurance for low-income and middle-income working Americans.\"",
      "Given that Sanders' proposed plan specifically calls health insurance an entitlement for all, we found that this is a mischaracterization at best.",
      "Sanders hasn't released a health care proposal as a presidential candidate, but his campaign has said a bill he introduced in the Senate in 2013 would serve as the model. Sanders has called the plan \"Medicare for all,\" referring to the the health safety net that covers those over 65.",
      "Clinton has a point that enacting the law would disrupt health insurance as we know it, said Gerald Friedman, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who has analyzed similar proposals.",
      "The bill, the American Health Security Act of 2013, specifically strips insurance benefits from the Affordable Care Act, the Children's Health Insurance Program, Medicare and Medicaid. The bill also bans the sale of private health insurance that duplicates benefits provided by the government program.",
      "And she is also right that states would be the primary administrators of the system. The bill calls it a \"state-based American Health Security Program.\" However, the assertion that it would empower Republican governors to take away individual's health insurance is misleading.",
      "Sanders' plan requires states to set up the specifics of their health care system, though they must meet federal standards for various administrative details. For example, states must identify a single agency to manage the program. If a state does not set up a system, or if they refuse to meet the federal standards, the federal government will step in and run that state's program.",
      "Clinton's comments seem to be based on how many Republican governors have reacted to the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, deciding not to accept an expansion of Medicaid, the government insurance program for low-income individuals.",
      "The Sanders' campaign said the provision that allows the federal government to step in and run state programs would prevent governors who oppose the law from refusing to provide health coverage for their residents or offering subpar programs.",
      "The bill also states that every U.S. resident \"is entitled to benefits for health care services\" and would require auto-enrollment at birth or at the point when someone becomes a legal resident.",
      "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's campaign told us that Chelsea Clinton's point was that the law would get rid of all of the existing benefits Obamacare, Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP, etc. for everyone.",
      "That may be true, but Sanders' health care seeks to immediately replace all of these programs, as well as attempt to cover all those currently uninsured. That would be a federal-level change, rather than governors choosing to scrap those federal programs, and Sanders' bill does make an effort to establish measures to circumvent the states that try to undermine the law.",
      "It sounds like Clinton is saying that millions would be left totally uninsured as a result of Sanders' plan giving more authority to governors, which isn't the case.",
      "\"Her claim is analogous to saying that Medicare dismantled private insurance for the elderly,\" said David Himmelstein, co-founder of Physicians for a National Health Program and an advocate for a national health insurance system. \"It replaced defective private coverage with something better.\"",
      "Hillary Clinton's campaign also emphasized that at the very least, state governments could administer the program in such a way that they provide low-quality insurance compared to other states, such as by limiting reimbursement rates for providers. The campaign noted that Sanders' bill says the federal government must fund between 81 and 91 percent of each state's program, so if a state doesn't cover the remaining costs, that could affect the services provided.",
      "One final note: It's not at all clear that Sanders' plan would pay for itself or be practical to implement. (We explored those issues in a separate story.) And his plan would certainly get rid of many existing programs. But Chelsea Clinton attacked the plan for one area that seems pretty clear, and that's its coverage provisions. The plan's defining feature is that it offers health insurance coverage to every American.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Chelsea Clinton said Sanders' health care plan would \"empower\" governors \"to take away health insurance for low-income and middle-income working Americans.\"",
      "Under Sanders' plan, Americans would lose their current health insurance. However, his proposal would replace their health insurance and cover the currently uninsured. The program would auto-enroll every citizen and legal resident, all of whom would be entitled to benefits. While the plan would give governors authority to administer health insurance within their states, it includes provisions to allow federal authorities to take over if the governors refuse to implement it.",
      "It's impossible to predict with certainty how Sanders' plan would play out in real life. But Clinton's statement makes it sound like Sanders' plan would leave many people uninsured, which is antithetical to the goal of Sanders' proposal: universal health care.",

      "The State Department confirmed July 6 that it was aware of two emails that were marked confidential, the lowest level of classification, when they were sent. An aide sent the two emails to Clinton to prepare her for phone calls with foreign leaders, according to the New York Times.",
      "State Department spokesman John Kirby said call sheets are often classified when they are prepared. But then at some point before the call is made, someone with the appropriate authority will declassify them. These two call sheets sent to Clinton unnecessarily retained their confidential markings due to human error, Kirby said.",
      "Even though just two emails out of many thousands were marked classified at the time they were sent, it's more than the number Clinton cited: zero.",
      "In total, the investigation found 110 emails in 52 email chains containing information that was classified at the time it was sent or received. Eight chains contained top secret information, the highest level of classification, 36 chains contained secret information, and the remaining eight contained confidential information. Most of these emails, however, did not contain markings clearly delineating their status.",
      "Even so, Clinton and her team still should have known the information was not appropriate for an unclassified system, Comey said.",
      "\"There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about the matters should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation,\" Comey said of some of the top secret chains.",
      "About 2,000 additional emails have been retroactively classified, or up-classified, meaning the information was not classified when it was first emailed. This is a regular practice when documents are reviewed for release, according to transparency experts.",
      "Throughout this saga, Clinton has said she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department. But Comey said FBI investigators uncovered \"several thousand\" work-related emails that she had not handed over, and three of those were classified at the time they were sent, though they were not marked as such.",
      "Comey added that some work-related emails are still out there, but FBI investigators were unable to find them. It's possible those emails could contain classified information.",
      "The Clinton campaign told PolitiFact they do not know which emails Comey is referring to and reiterated the fact that the State Department has not said any were classified at the time they were sent.",
      "The context",
      "Some of Clinton's emails now made public actually show Clinton's team talking about how they couldn't email each other classified information over the private server and instead have to move the conversation to a more appropriate venue. Clinton has said she viewed classified information in hard copy in her office. If she was traveling, she used other secure channels.",
      "But the FBI investigation found that Clinton sent and received classified information over her private server.",
      "Why the disconnect?",
      "Experts say the story here is more about the dysfunction of government classification than about how Clinton regularly handled sensitive information.",
      "Agencies regularly disagree over what should be classified or not. As the email story has unfolded, the State Department has squabbled with the intelligence community over whether certain emails should be classified today and if it was classified back when it was sent during Clinton's tenure.",
      "\"The decision to mark a document is more art than science and leads to bureaucratic in-fighting on whether something should be classified or not,\" said Gary Bass, Bauman Foundation executive director and former director of OMB Watch, a government accountability organization.",
      "Also, transparency advocates say the government regularly classifies more than it needs to. The government classifies incorrectly 70 percent of the time, according to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel.",
      "Thomas Blanton, director of the National Security Archive at George Washington University said some of the classified material the FBI identified might not be particularly sensitive.\" There is not a line in any of Mrs. Clinton's emails that meets the smell test of classification, which is their release would be damaging to our national security,\" he said.",
      "Given these concerns, it's reasonable to give Clinton a little benefit of the doubt regarding how she treated classified information that landed in her inbox unlabeled, said Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists.",
      "\"If it had been marked as classified and she or her staff transmitted it through non-secure email anyway, that would have been an overt violation of procedures,\" Aftergood said. \"If it wasn't marked as classified, then it could easily have been handled in good faith as unclassified.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Clinton said, \"I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified.\"",
      "Clinton has made this claim over and over again. An independent FBI investigation has found that to be inaccurate.",
      "It's important to remember that only \"a very small number\" of her emails, two, were marked classified when they were first sent, and just 110 out of the 30,000 she turned over were classified but unmarked. Evidence seems to indicate that Clinton generally dealt with classified information in an appropriate manner.",
      "But over the course of a year, Clinton and her staff have painted a picture of an email setup where absolutely zero classified information slipped through the cracks, case closed.",
      "We rate this statement False.",
      "Editor's note: The day after we published this fact-check, Comey testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on July 7. Comey said he believes three emails on Clinton's server contained information labeled classified at the time they were sent. This information was not properly marked in that the emails did not have a classification header, even though a \"(c)\" immediately preceded text in the body of the emails, designating confidential information. Without the clear classification header, it's reasonable to infer that Clinton did not realize these three emails contained classified information, he said."

      "And that doesn't include the requirements for security.",
      "Thus, the president always uses Air Force One, which is one of two specially designed Boeing 747s built in 1986 to include a command center, a medical suite, bedroom, office, two food preparation galleys, and plenty of room for staff and reporters.",
      "It's not cheap to operate.",
      "According to CNN, the Air Force was reporting two years ago it cost $206,337 an hour to operate the jet. It's not clear what that covers. A General Accounting Office analysis of three overseas presidential trips in 1998 reported an hourly cost of $34,400, which would be $50,700 per hour in 2016 dollars.",
      "Technically, if the president makes a campaign trip, the campaign or the political party is supposed to reimburse the government for use of the plane to some degree. (The full cost is not reimbursed because some of the costs are directly connected to the responsibilities of being president.)",
      "These days, the amount is the price of chartering a 737, which is a bit over $11,000 an hour, according to the Washington Post. Prior to 2010, the required reimbursement was nothing more than the cost of a first-class ticket on a commercial airline.",
      "When you have someone traveling on behalf of a campaign, such as Clinton and any staffers who might be accompanying her, the accounting can get even more complicated.",
      "But how it's calculated by the White House Airlift Operations office isn't known. The government does not release details of how it figures such costs, and that's been a secret going back to the 1970s, according to CNN.",
      "The amount is even more complicated when the president mixes business with politics, such as flying somewhere to give a policy speech or performing another official act but also spending time attending a purely political event, such as a fundraiser. (The North Carolina appearance, in contrast, was purely political.)",
      "How much taxpayers end up paying when business is mixed with politics isn't clear because, once again, the formula for calculating the share paid by the campaign and the government is secret. The White House Counsel's office makes a determination on how political a trip is, according to Time magazine.",

      "The closest you can get to getting an estimate is to see what the campaigns pay the government.",
      "For his re-election in 2004, George W. Bush's campaign paid just under $1 million, according to the Post. But that was when the cost was based on a first-class commercial airline ticket. By 2012, after the rules were changed to be based on chartering a 737, Obama spent just over $3 million.",
      "In this case, Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin said the campaign will cover its portion of the costs, although he indicated those costs had not been determined.",
      "The Trump campaign didn't respond to an email, but Trump is well aware that campaigns are required, by federal law, to reimburse for expenses.",
      "During his trip to Scotland last month, Trump went to great lengths to repeatedly state that federal law requires his campaign to pay for everything, even if it's the use of a conference room in Trump Towers, which he said he would gladly let his campaign use for free.",
      "\"I'm forced, you know, legally, I have to pay myself back,\" he said. \"If I use one of my resorts in the United States and we have a press conference or something, by law I have to pay myself back.\"",

      "Trump said, \"Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail\" by Obama and Clinton.",
      "How people define a fortune is somewhat subjective, and details about how the costs of using the presidential plane are determined are secret.",
      "But based on the information available, it's clear that the campaign is only going to be picking up a small fraction of the $200,000-plus hourly costs of using the plane, with taxpayers footing the bill for the rest.",

      "The Loretta Lynch who helped Bill Clinton in the Whitewater case is a white woman who got a law degree from Yale and worked on several political campaigns, including Clinton's.

      "President Barack Obama attracted attention for a bold assertion about how easy it is to obtain a gun during his speech at an interfaith memorial service for five officers slain by a sniper in Dallas, Texas.",
      "\"As a society, we choose to underinvest in decent schools,\" he said. \"We allow poverty to fester so that entire neighborhoods offer no prospect for gainful employment. We refuse to fund drug treatment and mental health programs. We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book, and then we tell the police, You're a social worker, you're the parent, you're the teacher, you're the drug counselor.'\"",
      "Critics pounced on the Glock remark, saying Obama was making a misleading or even outright false comparison. But the White House said it had evidence to back up Obama's line.",
      "So we decided to take our own look.",
      "What the White House says",
      "The White House offered PolitiFact several news reports to back up Obama's case.",
      "The gist of these reports was that there are lots of guns to be found in low-income urban areas, but comparatively few books and relatively little access to the Internet.",
      "However, much of the evidence these articles provided was anecdotal, and none of the articles directly compared guns to computers or books --- not to mention Glocks, the specific make of handgun Obama cited.",
      "And none of the articles offered a rigorous academic comparison of the specific claim Obama made.",
      "For example:",
      "One study by New York University researchers found a scarcity of children's books in low-income areas of Detroit, Los Angeles and Washington. But the study looked at stores that sold books without taking into account public libraries or school libraries, which make obtaining books easier. More importantly, the study didn't compare the availability of guns.",
      "Several articles offered quotes by people familiar with low-income communities that included observations similar to what Obama said in Dallas.",
      "For instance, one Chicago resident told Al Jazeera America that getting a gun in her neighborhood is as easy as buying a pack of gum. \"If you want a gun, you can just go get a gun,\" she said. \"You got the money? You can get a gun.\"",
      "And D. Watkins, a young, African-American writer from Baltimore who wrote The Beast Side: Living and Dying While Black in America, told public radio host Terry Gross that he bought his first gun \"from some dudes in the neighborhood that sold guns. It was simple. ... (It was) Business as usual. And it's still like that.\"",
      "None of these accounts offered a direct comparison of guns' availability compared with books or Internet access.",
      "One link referenced an academic study about a lack of access to food in low-income areas, but it did not address either guns or books.",
      "A news report cited research about the relative lack of Internet access in low-income households. But another article the White House provided said that while teens in families making less than $50,000 a year are less likely to have access to a desktop or a laptop computer than teens in higher income groups, the rate even for the lower-income group is still pretty high: All told, eight of every 10 of these lower-income teens had access to a computer.",
      "In all, we find the White House's evidence unpersuasive on Obama's specific claim. There's no hard data making his comparison. And on the question of access to computers, we found data showing a relatively high rate of Internet access even among lower-income teens.",
      "Problems with the comparisons",
      "We considered the meaning of Obama's remark a few different ways but none provide a slam dunk for his argument.",
      "He said it was easier for a teen to obtain a Glock over a book or a computer.",
      "It might be easier for some people in some places, but it's still against the law.",
      "\"It is already against federal law for someone under the age of 21 to buy a handgun, such as a Glock, from a licensed firearms dealer,\" said John R. Lott, Jr., president of the generally pro-gun Crime Prevention Research Center. And federal law on handguns also makes it unlawful for anyone \"to sell, deliver, or otherwise transfer (a handgun) to a person who the transferor knows or has reasonable cause to believe is a juvenile\" that is, under 18.",
      "That means that any teen would have to break the law to make such a purchase. Alternately, they could barter for a handgun or steal one, which might be practical but would also be against the law.",
      "So let's now consider the case of teens who are willing to break the law.",
      "One interpretation is whether a gun is cheaper to get than a book. Experts said the price of a \"street\" handgun can range between $50 and $500, depending on the local vagaries of supply and demand.",
      "Glocks in particular \"are very expensive,\" said Alan Lizotte, a criminal justice professor at the University at Albany. Street Glocks without a criminal history would be especially tough, he said.",
      "That would make them easily more expensive than books purchased at a store, and certainly more expensive than books borrowed for free from a library.",
      "\"There are 80 public libraries in Chicago and 95 public high schools and 92 private high schools in the city,\" Lott said.",
      "The second interpretation of Obama's remark is the ease, or accessibility, of locating a gun. This is perhaps the most favorable interpretation for Obama, since credible research shows that there's both a relative shortage of books and a relative surplus of guns in low-income neighborhoods.",
      "But it's worth remembering that there don't appear to be any studies that compare books and guns directly. In addition, there's a lot of variation, neighborhood by neighborhood, across the country.",
      "\"If there's lots of street-gang activity where you live, you may know someone who can get you a gun,\" said James Alan Fox, interim director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University. \"If you live in a middle- or upper-middle class suburb, a gun may not be as accessible for a teenager. I wouldn't know who to ask to buy a street gun.\"",
      "Some points for Obama",
      "Experts acknowledged, though, that Obama had a point with his remark, even if he made an imperfect comparison.",
      "\"It is pretty easy for a teen to get a handgun at little cost and very quickly, at least in some places, including urban places,\" Lizotte said.",
      "That said, Jay Corzine, a sociologist and gun-policy expert at the University of Central Florida, called Obama's framing \"weird.\"",
      "\"The most credit I can give the president is that the statement may be true in a very small number of cases that are dependent on the context -- location, day of the week, time of the day, cash in hand,\" Corzine said.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Obama said, \"We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book.\"",
      "There's little doubt that in some lower-income and high-crime neighborhoods, it is strikingly easy for even teens to acquire a handgun. On this, there is ample anecdotal evidence.",
      "But buying a gun is not likely to be cheaper than buying -- or borrowing -- a book or securing access to a computer, even for teens in poor neighborhoods.",

      "Vice presidential nominees are often expected to act as attack dogs on a campaign ticket. Maybe Indiana Gov. Mike Pence was warming up for the role at a rally for Donald Trump in Indiana on July 12.",
      "Pence rattled off a series of reasons Hillary Clinton was not fit for the presidency. One of them caught our attention, a claim about Benghazi, the Libyan city where a 2012 terrorist attack left four Americans dead.",
      "\"We don't need a president that took 13 hours to send help to Americans under fire and after four brave Americans fell said what difference, at this point, does it make.' Anyone who did that, anyone who said that, should be disqualified from ever being commander in chief of the armed forces,\" Pence said.",
      "President Barack Obama's administration has been subject to a great deal of scrutiny during, before and after that attack, and much of that has been directed at Clinton.",
      "Several investigations have found, however, that no action by Clinton -- or anybody in the administration -- could have moved additional forces to Benghazi before the last American deaths.",
      "And if it were possible, Clinton was not responsible for sending help. That fell to military officials.",
      "The Benghazi timeline",
      "The attack on the diplomatic mission in Benghazi began at 9:40 p.m., Benghazi time. It took until after 10 a.m. the next morning for the last plane evacuating Americans to leave Benghazi the time from the initial attack to the final evacuation is Pence's \"13 hours.\" (For a more detailed timeline, see this document issued by the House's select committee on Benghazi or our fact-check of a claim about delays in the military's response.)",
      "At an 11 p.m. meeting (5 p.m. Washington time), President Barack Obama directed military officials to \"do everything possible\" to save lives in Benghazi. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta testified that he then ordered forces around the Mediterranean to move toward Libya. Clinton's department was ultimately responsible for the security setup at the Benghazi mission, but at this point it was the military, under the Defense Department and, ultimately, the president, that was moving forces toward Libya.",
      "None of the forces ordered to prepare to deploy to Benghazi ever reached the city in the aftermath of the attack. Eventually, it was decided that the Americans in Benghazi would evacuate to Tripoli, Libya's capital, and forces that would have gone to Benghazi were directed there, Libya's capital, where they were being evacuated to. The CIA station chief in Tripoli as opposed to anyone in Washington dispatched a team to work with local militia groups to extract the Americans in Benghazi.",
      "Clinton was active throughout the 13-hour period. She testified that she called Libya's president to see if friendly forces could be dispatched to help the Americans in Benghazi. She also spoke with the embassy in Tripoli and then-CIA director David Petraeus.",
      "There have been eight congressional investigations of Benghazi so far, most of which were run by Republicans. Several of their reports criticized Clinton and her State Department for the security setup in Benghazi, for their part in the administration messaging after the attack, and for not holding themselves accountable afterward.",
      "But they generally criticized the Defense Department or other parts of the administration, not Clinton or the State Department, for delays in deploying military assets the night of the attack. When Congressman Mike Pompeo asked Clinton, \"Why was heaven and earth not moved at the initial sound of guns,\" in terms of sending help, Clinton told him to ask the Defense Department.",
      "The House select committee on Benghazi concluded: \"The decisions made earlier in the year by senior State Department officials to maintain a presence in Benghazi without adequate security forces and an inadequately fortified Mission compound contributed to what amounted to a worst case scenario of circumstances that would test the military's preparedness and ability to respond.",
      "\"Nevertheless, the Defense Department did not pass the test.\"",
      "The committee went on to question why it took so long for orders from Obama and Panetta to translate into action on the ground.",
      "The committee's final report leaves open the possibility that the State Department might have further impeded the speed of reaction to Benghazi.",
      "\"Whether this failure is shouldered by (the Defense Department) alone, or rests in part on decisions made by the State Department in Washington D.C. or with the White House... is one of the lingering questions about Benghazi,\" the report reads. This brings up the possibility that the State Department delayed help, but that wasn't Pence's claim.",
      "And, based on the generally accepted timeline of the attack, its appears likely the delay ended up being immaterial. Different Republican-led congressional investigations have concluded that additional forces could not have reached Benghazi in time to matter. Even if Clinton was responsible for the response to the attack, it's not clear what she could have done to overcome what military officials called \"the tyranny of time and distance.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Pence claimed that Clinton \"took 13 hours to send help to Americans under fire.\"",
      "In fact, it wasn't Clinton's responsibility to send troops to the scene the military chain of command took that responsibility. The Defense Department attempted to send help to the scene, but was unable to reach Benghazi before the deaths occurred.",
      "Pence implied that Clinton dawdled before sending help to Americans in danger. That is not accurate. We rate this claim False.",

      "It's nice that Trump added the word \"essentially,\" but the charge is still not without faults.",
      "When we last looked at the claim, we found no evidence that Clinton has ever said she wants to repeal or abolish the Second Amendment. She has called for stronger regulations, but continuously affirms her support for the right to bear arms.",

      "Straight shooting on the campaign trail",
      "In both her 2008 and 2016 White House bids, Clinton has called for more gun control all the while saying she \"believes in the Second Amendment.\"",
      "Here are a few examples of comments she's made:",
      "January 2008, Democratic presidential debate: \"I believe in the Second Amendment. People have a right to bear arms. But I also believe that we can common-sensically approach this.\"",
      "August 2015, in response to the on-air murders of a news crew in Virginia: \"We are smart enough, compassionate enough to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights concerns with preventive measures and control measures, so whatever motivated this murderer ... we will not see more needless, senseless deaths.\"",
      "January 2016, on Twitter: \"Nobody's attacking the Second Amendment. We can protect Americans' rights and also protect families from gun violence. #GOPdebate\"",
      "June 2016, on ABC's This Week: \"I believe we can have common-sense gun-safety measures consistent with the Second Amendment.\" (More on this later.)",
      "Setting aside the bulk of Clinton's comments on protecting the Second Amendment (examples here, here, here, here, here and here), we'll now go over three points that some gun rights advocates and experts say gives Trump's charge some credence.",
      "Smoking guns?",
      "Clinton riled the gun lobby with two eyebrow-raising comments last fall and one from this spring.",
      "Clinton said in October 2015 a national gun buyback program like Australia's compulsory program was \"worth looking into.\" After a gunman killed 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in 1996, Australia banned semiautomatic and automatic weapons and enacted a mandatory buyback of the newly prohibited guns.",
      "That program is \"incompatible with private ownership of guns,\" Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told us in May. (The National Rifle Association shares this view.)",
      "The full context of Clinton's response, however, suggests she may have misspoken or not fully understood Australia's program, as she also evoked voluntary buybacks as potential models for a U.S. program.",
      "Second, Clinton said in a leaked recording of a private fundraiser that she thinks the Supreme Court \"is wrong on the Second Amendment,\" referring to its landmark ruling in District of Columbia vs. Heller. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down Washington's handgun ban and recognized that the Second Amendment applies to the individual's right to bear arms.",
      "Experts who support gun rights told us undoing Heller basically ends the Second Amendment as currently interpreted. They pointed out that former Justice Department officials under President Bill Clinton and his appointees Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued in Heller that gun regulations do not violate the Second Amendment because it primarily pertains to a well-regulated militia, not the individual right to bear arms.",
      "Clinton, in her June interview on This Week, added fuel to the fire when she appeared to talk about the individual right as a hypothetical.",
      "\"Do you believe that their conclusion that an individual's right to bear arms is a constitutional right?\" host George Stephanopoulos asked.",
      "\"If it is a constitutional right, then it, like every other constitutional right, is subject to reasonable regulation,\" she responded. \"And what people have done with (the Heller) decision is to take it as far as they possibly can and reject what has been our history from the very beginning of the republic, where some of the earliest laws that were passed were about firearms.\"",
      "The NRA and voices on the right seized upon these comments as proof that Clinton doesn't really believe in the individual right to bear arms. But that ignores what she said immediately after:",
      "\"So I think it's important to recognize that reasonable people can say, as I do, responsible gun owners have a right I have no objection to that. But the rest of the American public has a right to require certain kinds of regularity, responsible actions to protect everyone else.\"",
      "UCLA Second Amendment expert Adam Winkler, meanwhile, said that the accuracy of Trump's charge depends on Clinton's grounds for rejecting Heller. (According to news reports from the 2008 election, she supported Washington's handgun ban.)",
      "\"If she thought the reasoning was wrong, but the result right, then she would fit in with a number of strong pro-gun advocates,\" he said. \"If, however, she thought there should be no protection for gun rights, then Trump's claim comes closer to the truth.\"",
      "The Clinton campaign previously told us Clinton \"believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe.\"",
      "This suggests Clinton disagrees with the court declaring the district's ban on handguns unconstitutional, not necessarily the individual right itself a position that's more or less in line with the George W. Bush administration's position on Heller of recognizing the right but allowing reasonable curtailment.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said, \"My opponent wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment.\"",
      "The addition of the word essentially doesn't change the accuracy of this claim. We found no evidence of Clinton ever saying verbatim or suggesting explicitly she wants to abolish the Second Amendment. The bulk of her comments suggest the opposite: She wants to enact stricter gun control, but has no objection to responsible gun ownership.",
      "Gun advocates say Trump's claim is backed up by Clinton's openness to a gun buyback program and her disagreement with a Supreme Court decision on the Second Amendment. But whether or not these cherry-picked comments actually reveal Clinton's intentions is a matter of interpretation.",

      "We'll give Trump credit for sticking close to what we presume is his source material. We located an almost identical passage in an article published in January 2016 by the Wonkblog team at the Washington Post: \"The number of homicides in the country's 50 largest cities rose nearly 17 percent last year, the greatest increase in lethal violence in a quarter century,\" the article began. The article cited Wonkblog's own calculations.",
      "However, Trump ignored some significant cautionary notes in that same story. The Post article said that a close look at the figures \"suggests no single explanation for the increases and reveals no clear pattern among those cities that experienced the most horrific violence.\"",
      "For instance, the article noted that other data shows a more modest increase. \"A preliminary FBI report released last week showed that the overall number of violent offenses increased just 1.7 percent nationally during the first half of the year while the number of property crimes declined 4.2 percent,\" the Post article noted.",
      "The article also noted that the increases are scattershot.",
      "\"There were more killings in Nashville, but the total in Memphis declined by 1 percent,\" the Post article noted. \"The number of homicides increased 25 percent in Houston, but decreased 9 percent in San Antonio. There were seven fewer homicides last year than in 2014 in Fresno, Calif., a decline of 15 percent. Meanwhile, up Highway 99 in Sacramento, there were 43 killings last year, an increase of 54 percent.\"",
      "\"There's no national pattern,\" Franklin Zimring, a criminologist at the University of California at Berkeley, told the Post.",
      "Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, agreed. \"Everything is basically anecdotal,\" he told the Post. \"There's not a clear national picture that I've been able to discern of what might be contributing to the changes.\"",
      "James Alan Fox, the interim director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University, told PolitiFact that the most recent data is heavily driven by four large cities with disproportionate increases -- Chicago, Houston, Washington and Baltimore.",
      "Fox and others urged PolitiFact not to make too much of changes in data over the course of a single year. It's better to look at a range of years to spot lasting trends.",
      "\"There is volatility in numbers like these,\" he said.",
      "For instance, he said, in 2012, there were more than 500 homicides in Chicago. That fell to the lower 400s each of the next two years before rising again to the high 400s in 2015.",
      "\"Ironically, some of the time when the numbers go up it may be because there was an unusually low number the previous year. A one-year change is not a reliable trend,\" Fox said.",
      "And over the long term, rates of violent crime have moved in the right direction. As we have previously noted, FBI data shows that violent crime has been falling on an almost uninterrupted basis since the early 1990s. The data below shows violent crime per 100,000 population from 1993 to 2014, the last full year for which data is available.",

      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said, \"Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's 50 largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years.\"",
      "The statement comes from a credible source -- calculations made by the Washington Post. However, in painting a bleak picture, Trump cherry-picks the Post's overall findings -- and makes mistakes criminologists warn about.",
      "The Post article acknowledged that FBI data found a smaller increase in recent years, with contradictory results for many cities. And experts caution against putting too much stock in short-term changes, since year-to-year data can be volatile for hard-to-discern reasons.",

      "In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, presidential candidate Donald Trump singled out \"the evangelical and religious community\" for their assistance in getting him nominated.",
      "\"They have much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits,\" he said.",
      "\"An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away,\" Trump said. \"I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans.\"",
      "We were curious about the issue and whether an amendment constitutional or otherwise prevents the practice for religious institutions.",
      "For this fact-check, we're relying largely scholarly articles in the Denver University Law Review, the Case Western Reserve Law Review, Boston College Law Review.",
      "The restriction is actually a law, not an amendment, and it isn't exclusive to religious institutions.",
      "Lyndon Johnson is best known as America's 36th president, the Texan who assumed the office when John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Texas politics can be rough, and Johnson knew how to play that game. Therein lies the origin of the \"Johnson amendment.\"",
      "The restriction was championed by LBJ in 1954 when Johnson was a U.S. senator running for re-election. A conservative nonprofit group that wanted to limit the treaty-making ability of the president produced material that called for electing his primary opponent, millionaire rancher-oilman Dudley Dougherty, and defeating Johnson. There was no church involved.",
      "Johnson, then Democratic minority leader, responded by introducing an amendment to Section 501(c)(3) of the federal tax code dealing with tax-exempt charitable organizations, including groups organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literacy and educational purposes, or to prevent cruelty to children or animals. It said, in effect, that if you want to be absolved from paying taxes, you couldn't be involved in partisan politics.",
      "There was no record of any debate around the amendment.",
      "\"The logical argument favoring such an amendment is that those corporations qualifying for the section 501(c)(3) tax subsidy should not be permitted to directly or indirectly use that subsidy to support candidates for office,\" said Michael Hone in the Case Western article.",
      "However it was likely, he said, that \"Johnson was motivated by a desire to exact revenge on the foundation he believed supported his opponent and to prevent it and other nonprofit corporations from acting similarly in the future.\"",
      "Nonetheless, \"Subsequently it proved to have a profound effect on how thousands of tax-exempt organizations including churches dealt with issues relating to political campaigns,\" according to Patrick O'Daniel of the University of Texas School of Law in the Boston College article.",
      "The law says all such organizations \"are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office.\" That includes contributions to political campaigns and any form of public statement for or against a candidate or group of candidates.",
      "Violating the restriction could result in the revocation of the organization's tax exempt status and the imposition of taxes.",
      "Nonpartisan, unbiased voter education or similar activities such as church-organized voter registration drives are allowed.",
      "Historically, that hasn't stopped some religious organizations from issuing endorsements anyway.",
      "O'Daniel has a list of examples. To cite two from 2000:",
      "Rev. Jerry Falwell told worshippers at the Genoa Baptist Church in Ohio to \"vote for the Bush of your choice\" and \"We simply have to beat (Al) Gore.\"",
      "That same year, a pastor at a Bronx church who supported Hillary Clinton's run for the U.S. Senate at the time, substituted her opponent's name for Satan during a hymn.",
      "\"In the face of lackluster opposition by the Internal Revenue Service, the Democrats and Republicans . . . continue to use the literal bully pulpits of the churches to preach to the party faithful,\" O'Daniel wrote.",
      "Nonetheless, the threat of losing tax-exempt status persists as long as the law is in place, and politically-minded religious groups, particularly evangelicals, have regarded it as a suppression of free speech and an entanglement of the IRS in the operation of their religion.",
      "In 2008, for example, pastors in 20 states organized to give politically-oriented sermons to protest the law, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "The GOP platform has picked up that cudgel, calling for the repeal of that portion of the tax law.",
      "The Johnson amendment survived court challenges in 1983, 1990 and 2000, according to Pew.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said, \"An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views.\"",
      "Trump is correct that the law was pushed by Johnson and that religious groups that advocate for candidates risk losing their tax exempt status.",
      "It's important to note that the prohibition is not just restricted to religious institutions. It's nonprofit charitable organizations in general.",
      "But overall, we rate the statement as True."

      "Donald Trump is a huge fan of the word \"huge.\" At the Democratic convention, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders relished the chance to turn the word against the GOP nominee.",
      "\"While Donald Trump believes in huge tax breaks -- huuuuge tax breaks -- for billionaires, he believes that states should actually have the right to lower the minimum wage below $7 and a quarter,\" Sanders said.",
      "Trump's stance on the federal minimum wage it's currently $7.25 has been a moving target, and we've done our best to track it.",
      "Sanders' charge lines up most closely with what Trump said during a May 8, 2016, interview on NBC's Meet the Press. Host Chuck Todd aimed to clarify Trump's views. Here's the key exchange:",
      "Todd: \"Should the federal government set a floor, and then you let the states --\"",
      "Trump: \"No, I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck. So I like the idea of let the states decide. But I think people should get more. I think they're out there. They're working. It is a very low number. You know, with what's happened to the economy, with what's happened to the cost. I mean, it's just -- I don't know how you live on $7.25 an hour. But I would say let the states decide.\"",
      "So while Trump voiced sympathy for low-wage workers, he rejected the idea that Washington should set a minimum and carried it further to say that states should use the wage \"to compete with each other.\"",
      "If Trump had expressed that policy consistently, there would be no debate on his views. But here are other excerpts from Trump on the minimum wage:",
      "In an interview with MSNBC in August 2015, Trump said, \"Having a low minimum wage is not a bad thing for this country.\"",
      "During the Republican debate in Milwaukee in November 2015, Trump said wages are \"too high\" and, when asked whether he would raise the minimum wage, said, \"I would not do it.\"",
      "On ABC's This Week on May 8, 2016, host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump, \"Minimum wage -- all through the primaries, you were against an increase. Now you're saying you're looking at it. So what's your bottom line on this?\" Trump responded, \"Well, I am looking at it and I haven't decided in terms of numbers. But I think people have to get more.\" When Stephanopoulos asked whether that's a change, Trump answered, \"Well, sure it's a change. I'm allowed to change. You need flexibility.\"",
      "Looking at all his statements, we see that most of the time Trump says that he would like to see people earning more than the current minimum wage. But on the separate issue of whether Washington should mandate a hike, he is at best ambivalent, and more often than not, he opposes that.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Sanders said that Trump believes that states should have the right to lower the minimum wage. Looking strictly at Trump's words, at one point, in that Meet the Press interview, he said states should have the right to set their own minimum wage and rejected the idea that the federal government should set it for the country.",
      "The only quibble with Sanders' statement is he talked about what Trump believes, as if Trump's policy is fixed and steady. It isn't that simple. Trump suggested in one interview that he might consider raising the federal minimum wage. But most of the time, he has not expressed that view. Nor has Trump said anything recently to clarify his position.",

      "During a press conference in Florida while Democrats were preparing for the third night of their national convention in Philadelphia, Donald Trump was asked a question about his stance on whether to raise the minimum wage.",
      "Here's what he said:",
      "\"The minimum wage has to go up. People are -- at least $10, but it has to go up. But I think that states -- federal -- I think that states should really call the shot. As an example, I live in New York. It's very expensive in New York. You can't buy a hot dog for the money you're talking about. You go to other states and it's not expensive at all. Now what it does is puts New York at a disadvantage if the minimum wage is up, companies move out and things, bad things happen. At the same time, people have to be taken care of. But what I'm really going to do on the minimum wage -- but it has to go up.. .. So I would like to raise it to at least $10.\"",
      "A journalist then followed up, \"You said we need to raise it to $10. Are you talking about the federal minimum wage?\" Trump confirmed, \"Federal.\"",
      "Some saw the Florida remarks as a change to Trump's previous position on whether there should be a federal minimum wage floor for the entire country. Were they?",
      "Before we go any further, let's recap how the minimum wage works in the United States.",
      "There is a federal minimum wage -- currently $7.25 -- that serves as a floor beneath which no state's minimum wage can fall. Any states, however, can set their minimum wage level higher than $7.25. (There are exceptions to the $7.25 minimum wage level for some workers, such as those who survive heavily on tips.)",
      "The clearest counterpoint to Trump's Florida comments came from an interview on NBC's Meet the Press on May 8. We cited this exchange in our July 8 fact check, in which we gave a True rating to an assertion by Hillary Clinton that Trump \"wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage.\"",
      "In the fact-check, we noted that Trump told NBC's Chuck Todd that he preferred that states -- not the federal government -- act on their own to raise the minimum wage.",
      "\"I would like to see an increase of some magnitude,\" Trump told Todd. \"But I'd rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Because don't forget, the states have to compete with each other.\"",
      "When Todd asked specifically, \"Should the federal government set a floor\" for the minimum wage?\" Trump replied, \"No. I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do.\"",
      "Now, fast-forward nearly three months to Trump's Florida news conference.",
      "His comments at the news conference seemed to embrace a national rise in the minimum wage -- specifically, he said, \"The minimum wage has to go up. ... at least $10, but it has to go up.\" And he clarified that that meant, \"federal.\"",
      "That's a clearer commitment to hiking the minimum wage for every American than Trump had made in his comments to Todd.",
      "At the same time, though, Trump also said, \"I think that states should really call the shot.\" This essentially kept Trump's focus on the states acting on their own.",
      "Trump's apparent advocacy for a national $10 minimum wage in his Florida comments does go further than some of his other prior statements on the issue.",
      "In an interview with MSNBC in August 2015, Trump said, \"Having a low minimum wage is not a bad thing for this country.\"",
      "During the Republican debate in Milwaukee in November 2015, Trump said wages are \"too high\" and, when asked whether he would raise the minimum wage, said, \"I would not do it.\"",

But I think people have to get more.\" When Stephanopoulos asked whether that's a change, Trump answered, \"Well, sure it's a change. I'm allowed to change. You need flexibility.\"",
      "A final note: Trump's most recent comments on the issue were a brief exchange in a longer press conference. It's possible he may adjust his views again in the future. Trump's press office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.",
      "Our ruling",
      "On the question of whether the federal government should set a minimum wage, Trump seems to have made a shift between his Meet the Press comments and his Florida news conference.",
      "In the Meet the Press interview, Trump explicitly said he doesn't want the federal government raising, or even setting, the minimum wage floor. By contrast, in the Florida news conference, he said the \"federal\" minimum wage \"has to go up.\"",
      "Trump emphasized in both instances that he prefers the states to raise their minimum wages on their own, so it's fair to say that Trump is sending conflicting messages. Still, his contrast on the question of a federal minimum wage hike is pretty stark. We rate this a Full Flop."

      "Hillary Clinton's eponymous nonprofit foundation provided ready-made fodder for a series of attacks from Donald Trump.",
      "In a major speech last week, the presumptive Republican nominee recited a number of claims from Clinton Cash, a 2015 bestselling investigation into donations to the Clinton Foundation.",
      "Among them: \"Hillary Clinton's State Department approved the transfer of 20 percent of America's uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation $145 million dollars.\"",
      "We wanted to vet this charge of Clinton engaging in pay-to-play politics.",
      "Trump's claim is a reductive version of his source material's findings and runs into several problems.",
      "First, the State Department did approve of Russia's gradual takeover of a company with significant U.S. uranium assets, but it didn't act unilaterally. State was one of nine government agencies, not to mention independent federal and state nuclear regulators, that had to sign off on the deal.",
      "Second, while nine people related to the company did donate to the Clinton Foundation, it's unclear whether they were still involved in the company by the time of the Russian deal and stood to benefit from it.",
      "Third, most of their Clinton Foundation donations occurred before and during Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential bid, before she could have known she would become secretary of state.",
      "The bottom line: While the connections between the Clinton Foundation and the Russian deal may appear fishy, there's simply no proof of any quid pro quo.",
      "Clinton's unsubstantiated role",
      "Did Clinton singlehandedly imperil national security by greenlighting the Russian deal, as Trump implies? No.",
      "The company in question, Uranium One, does have mines, mills and tracts of land in Wyoming, Utah and other U.S. states equal to about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity. It churns out a smaller portion of actual uranium produced in the United States (11 percent in 2014), according to Oilprice.com.",
      "But that's less cause for alarm than Trump is suggesting.",
      "For one, the United States doesn't actually produce all that much uranium (about 2 percent in 2015) and is actually a net importer of the chemical, according to Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear nonproliferation expert at Middlebury Institute and former director at the New America Foundation.",
      "For another, Russia doesn't have the licenses to export uranium outside the United States, Oilprice.org pointed out, \"so it's somewhat disingenuous to say this uranium is now Russia's, to do with what it pleases.\" The Kremlin was likely more interested in Uranium One's assets in Kazakhstan, the world's largest producer.",
      "Trump is also wrong that Clinton alone allowed the transfer.",
      "The Kremlin's 2010 purchase of a controlling stake in Uranium One had to be approved by the nine members of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.",
      "That included Clinton as secretary of state, but also the secretaries of the Treasury (the chairman of the committee), Defense, Justice, Commerce, Energy and Homeland Security as well as the the heads of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The deal also had to be okayed by the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission as well as Utah's nuclear regulator.",
      "While it's conceivable Clinton advocated for the deal, the author of Clinton Cash Peter Schweizer himself admitted that he doesn't have \"direct evidence\" proving Clinton played a part. The State Department's principal representative on the committee, Jose Fernandez, told Time that Clinton \"never intervened with me on any CFIUS matter.\"",
      "Why on earth would the United States allow the transfer of a uranium company?",
      "As others, including a New York Times' investigation, have explained, the United States was still seeking to \"reset\" its relationship with Russia and trying to get the Kremlin on board with its Iran nuclear deal. But at the end of the day, the Russian deal wasn't that big.",
      "Russia's purchase of the company \"had as much of an impact on national security as it would have if they set the money on fire,\" said Lewis. \"That's probably why (CFIUS and the NRC ) approved it.\"",
      "A condensed timeline",
      "Trump's suggestion that the Russian deal occurred \"while nine investors funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation\" is not supported by the evidence presented in Clinton Cash.",
      "On the contrary, the donations detailed by author Schweizer occurred at least two years before the deal. Furthermore, it's not clear from the book whether all nine of the Clinton Foundation donors were actually involved in the Russian deal at all.",
      "The timeline is key here, so bear with us. Uranium One had several facelifts between 2007 and 2013.",
      "Back in 2007, it was a South African company that had mining assets in Africa and Australia. That spring, it merged with another mining company, the Canada-based UrAsia Energy. The combined company kept Uranium One as its name but Toronto as its base. Under the terms of the deal, the shareholders of UrAsia retained a 60 percent stake in the new company.",
      "Russia didn't get involved until two years later, in June 2009, when its nuclear agency started buying shares in Uranium One. The Kremlin upped its stake in the company from 17 percent to a controlling 51 percent the following year, and assumed total ownership of the company in 2013 (and renamed it to Uranium One Holding).",
      "Out of the nine investors listed in Clinton Cash, five were linked to UrAsia only, and Schweizer doesn't say whether they were still involved with the company after the merger and when Russia was buying it out. (We asked Schweizer's publicist via email, but we didn't hear back.)",
      "Using SEDAR, Canada's filing system for public companies, we could only verify one UrAsia shareholder (Ian Telfer) who also owned stocks in Uranium One in 2010 and who chaired its Board of Directors. A New York Times investigation on the topic linked two others to Uranium One.",
      "Why does it matter? Because UrAsia investors could have conceivably sold their shares before they could have profited off the Russian deal. In other words, giving to the Clinton Foundation wouldn't have mattered to the allegedly Clinton-backed acquisition of 2010 if they had no stake in it.",

      "Pressed by host Chuck Todd to back up his claim, Cruz cited reports by ABC and CNN. A Cruz spokesman forwarded us several other media reports detailing the real estate developer's alleged ties to organized crime. The Trump campaign did not get back to us.",
      "Is Cruz right that the Donald has worked with a few Dons in his career?",
      "HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER",
      "It's important to note that Trump hasn't been charged with any illegal activity, and it's reasonable to argue that he was unaware or even a victim in some cases. But Cruz has a point that the mogul has been linked to the mob for decades.",
      "Mob control a fact of life'",
      "Before we detail Trump's alleged ties, none of this proves that Trump was happy doing business with the mafia or even in cahoots with them at all.",
      "La Cosa Nostra had a virtual monopoly on concrete in New York at the time Trump was adding his name to its skyline in the 1980s. And the mafia's control over building supplies and labor unions meant that the crime families had a hand in most construction projects in Manhattan.",
      "Trump and other major developers \"had to adapt to that situation\" or build elsewhere, said James B. Jacobs, a mafia expert who was part of a state task force on organized crime.",
      "\"That was the fact of life, that was the way it was,\" he told PolitiFact. \"The contractors and developers weren't pure victims. You could bribe the mob-controlled union leaders and get relief from the more arduous conflicts. But we had no information that Trump was any different.\"",
      "That being said, Trump's business dealings with the mob or mob-related characters are widely documented. Let's run through them.",
      "Mafia concrete for Trump Plaza",
      "Trump was first tied to the mafia in the 1980s, when a $7.8 million subcontract for Trump Plaza was awarded to S&A Concrete, according to Fortune. The company, as Cruz correctly says, was partially owned by Anthony \"Fat Tony\" Salerno, the boss of the Genovese crime family.",
      "Trump himself acknowledged as much in a December 2015 interview with the Wall Street Journal, admitting that S&A Concrete was \"supposedly associated with the mob.\"",
      "\"Virtually every building that was built was built with these companies,\" he said, adding, \"These guys were excellent contractors. They were phenomenal. They could do three floors a week in concrete. Nobody else in the world could do three floors a week. I mean they were unbelievable. Trump Tower, other buildings.\"",
      "When Salerno was indicted in 1986, the charges specifically mentioned Trump Plaza. Salerno's 1992 obituary ends with a nod to the luxury highrise and 15 other Manhattan buildings.",
      "Trump World Tower, supported by the Quadrozzi Concrete Company, is also tangentially related to La Cosa Nostra. The head of the company, John Quadrozzi Sr., was tied to the Lucchese crime family and indicted for making illegal payoffs to the mob in 1992.",
      "TIME and Daily Beast have speculated that Trump Tower was also built with mafia influence, though the evidence is less concrete.",
      "Atlantic City partnerships",
      "Trump's alleged mob dealings were not confined to New York. According to reports from the Huffington Post and Philadelphia Inquirer, Trump made a deal in Atlantic City with Kenneth Shapiro, an associate of mob boss Nicky Scarfo, and mob-connected labor boss Daniel Sullivan.",
      "Trump seemed aware of this, calling Shapiro \"a third-rate, local real estate mafia\" and Sullivan \"the guy who killed Jimmy Hoffa.\"",
      "Nonetheless, in 1981, Trump leased a portion of the land for Trump Plaza and Casino from a company the two men controlled, according a report by New Jersey gaming regulators. The company refused to cooperate with the authorities, and Trump eventually ended the partnership and bought out their shares.",
      "Later Trump brought on Sullivan as a labor negotiator at the Grand Hyatt Hotel and introduced the man to his own banker, according to the Los Angeles Times.",
      "Through intermediaries Trump bought the property for the casino from the \"crown prince\" of the Philadelphia mob, Salvatore Testa, for $1.1 million in 1982. Multiple media reports and an unauthorized biography about Trump allege this was more than twice its market value. (Testa purchased the property in 1977 for $195,000.)",
      "According to The Federalist, two construction companies controlled by Nicky Scarfo ended up building Trump Plaza and Casino.",
      "\"You had contractors that were supposedly mob-oriented all over Atlantic City,\" Trump said when the Wall Street Journal asked him about it, adding that \"every single casino company used the same companies, just I hope you will say that.\"",
      "A few years later, Trump's organized crime connections extended overseas. In 1992, a Senate subcommittee named Danny Leung, who was then the vice president for foreign marketing at Trump Taj Mahal, as an associate of the Hong Kong-based organized crime group 14K Triad.",
      "\"Leung has also given complimentary tickets for hotel rooms and Asian shows to numerous members and associates of Asian organized crime,\" reads the report, which also identified three other triad-connected business associates or former employees of Trump's gambling empire.",
      "According to gaming regulators, Leung \"flew in 16 Italian organized crime figures from Canada who stole more than $1 million from the casino in a credit scam,\" reported the New York Daily News in 1995. \"The incident was never reported because Trump never filed charges.\"",
      "Leung, who had a separate contract to bring gamblers from Toronto to the casino, denied the affiliation to organized crime, and his casino and junket licenses were renewed. (The Trump Taj Mahal declared bankruptcy in 1991, and his other Atlantic City properties folded a decade later.)",

      "In a series of notably sharper exchanges between Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich., had both candidates emphasizing their fundamental differences.",
      "After Clinton laid out how she would boost industrial jobs in America, partly by going after companies that aim to shift production overseas, Sanders accused her of finding \"religion on this issue, but it's a little bit too late.\"",
      "\"Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America,\" Sanders said. \"NAFTA, supported by the secretary, cost us 800,000 jobs nationwide, tens of thousands of jobs in the Midwest.\"",
      "NAFTA is the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. It significantly reduced trade tariffs among the United States, Mexico and Canada. Hillary Clinton obviously had no vote on the deal, but in 1996, during her husband's presidency, she did say \"I think NAFTA is proving its worth.\" Since then, she has said it \"has not delivered\" and should be fixed.",
      "Our focus is whether in fact, the trade deal caused the loss of 800,000 American jobs.",
      "Competing studies",
      "The Sanders campaign pointed us to work by the Economic Policy Institute, a research group that gets about a quarter of its funding from unions. A 2014 report from the group found that from 1993 to 2013, \"the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico and Canada increased from $17 (billion) to $177.2 billion, displacing 851,700 U.S. jobs. All of the net jobs displaced were due to growing trade deficits with Mexico.\"",
      "The author of that study, Robert Scott, said he went industry by industry and converted trade deficit and surpluses into an estimated number of jobs. Since the United States has a trade deficit with Mexico, it has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs to Mexico.",
      "But other analyses say the impacts were much less dramatic.",
      "HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER",
      "The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan policy arm of Congress, summarized a number of studies on NAFTA's legacy. That report said it is difficult to tease out the effects of the trade deal by itself. Factors such as economic growth, inflation and changes in exchange rates cloud the waters. That said, the report struck a measured tone.",
      "\"NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters,\" the report said. \"The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest.\"",
      "A similar review published by the international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reached the same conclusion.",
      "\"The net employment effects were relatively small, although there were adjustments across sectors displacing workers,\" the report said.",
      "In other words, jobs in certain industries, such as cars and electronics, might have suffered, but overall, the job impact was nominal.",
      "Economist Martin Baily at the Brookings Institution said Sanders' number \"looks high,\" and observed that it's possible that NAFTA has not cost the country any jobs.",
      "In 2014, a pair of researchers, Lorenzo Caliendo at Yale University and Fernando Parro at the Federal Reserve, drilled down to examine not just exchanges among the United States, Mexico and Canada, but how NAFTA affected trade around the world. In their model, if an industry exported more at a higher real price, then that was a win, or to use their terms, a positive impact on welfare. By that yardstick, NAFTA produced more gains for Mexico than the United States, but both countries were slightly better off.",
      "The China factor",
      "Economies are enormously complex systems and economists can reach different conclusions based on the factors they consider and the assumptions they bring to bear. Part of what makes the legacy of NAFTA challenging to assess is that in the last year of his presidency, Bill Clinton signed legislation granting China permanent normal trade relations. From 2000 on, this had an enormous impact on trade between the two nations. That overlaps with about half the period when analysts have tried to gauge the effect of NAFTA.",
      "A 2014 report published by the Federal Reserve Board linked that change to major job losses in the United States. It \"reduced total employment growth by -19.5 percentage points from 1997 to 2007 versus the prior decade,\" the authors wrote. The impact was nearly twice as large for production workers than for non-production workers, but for both groups, the legislation reduced job growth.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Sanders said that NAFTA, which Clinton used to support, cost the U.S. economy 800,000 jobs. There is a report from a left-leaning policy group that reached that conclusion. On the other hand, many other nonpartisan reports found that the trade deal produced neither significant job losses nor job gains. This is a result of competing economic models and the challenges of teasing out the effects of NAFTA from everything else that has taken place in the economy.",
      "The report Sanders cited is an outlier, and his use of its findings ignores important facts that would give a different impression. We rate his statement Mostly False.",

      "Sen. Bernie Sanders didn't support the bailout that saved the auto industry, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said of her opponent ahead of the primary in Michigan, a state built on the auto business.",
      "\"He was against the auto bailout,\" Clinton said at a March 6 CNN debate in Flint, Mich. \"In January of 2009, President-elect Obama asked everybody in the Congress to vote for the bailout. The money was there and had to be released in order to save the American auto industry and 4 million jobs and to begin the restructuring. We had the best year that the auto industry has had in a long time. I voted to save the auto industry. He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry.\"",
      "Sanders seemed skeptical of this line of critique.",
      "",
      "\"Well, if you are talking about the Wall Street bailout, where some of your friends destroyed this economy,\" he responded.",
      "Immediately a bunch of readers asked us to look into this claim to see if Sanders really did oppose the auto bailout, which many people believe rescued major automakers struggling to stay afloat during the 2008 Great Recession.",
      "First we'll lay out the auto bailout timeline, then we'll explain Sanders' votes. Basically, Sanders had two opportunities to show his support for auto bailout funds through Senate votes. He supported the bailout in one instance but not the other.",
      "In October 2008, Congress approved the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The money was intended to assist financial institutions, but it also ended up bailing out the auto industry.",
      "That December, Congress tried to pass a separate $14 billion bailout program specifically for the auto industry, which was in really bad shape. But the measure failed in the Senate, so President George W. Bush instead used his authority to allocate some of the TARP funds to General Motors and Chrysler.",
      "Just days before President Barack Obama started his first term in January 2009, some members of Congress tried to block the release of the the second half of the $700 billion TARP funds, a package that included some auto bailout money. The attempt failed, and the TARP funds went out to the banks and motor companies.",
      "So Sanders could have shown his support for the auto bailout in December 2008 when Congress tried and failed to pass an auto bailout and again in January 2009 when members considered blocking TARP funds.",
      "Sanders (and Clinton, too) voted in favor of the December separate auto bailout.",
      "\"I think it would be a terrible idea to add millions more to the unemployment rolls,\" Sanders said, according to Vermont Public Radio, explaining why he supported the measure.",
      "However and this is what Clinton is talking about Sanders voted to block the release of the second half of the TARP funding, including the auto bailout funds, while Clinton voted for the funds. (Sanders opposed and Clinton supported the initial TARP bill.)",
      "Sanders said he opposed bailout funding for financial firms, which is where the majority of TARP dollars were headed.",
      "\"I have strong reservations about continuing this bailout without strong taxpayer protections written into law,\" he said in a statement. \"I also object to using middle-class taxpayer money to bail out the exact same financial institutions whose greed and recklessness led to the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression.\"",
      "It's unclear how much of the second half of TARP funds Obama intended to use for the auto bailout at the time. In a letter to congressional leaders encouraging them to release the funds, Obama economic adviser Larry Summers said only that auto companies would \"only receive additional assistance in the context of a comprehensive restructuring designed to achieve long-term viability.\"",
      "Both of Michigan's then-senators, Democrats Debbie Stabenow and Carl Levin, advocated to continue TARP funding specifically to aid the auto industry, which has a heavy presence in their home state.",
      "Auto companies ended up receiving about about $85 billion in TARP funds, according to the New York Times. It's possible the auto industry would not have received such a robust bailout if Congress had successfully blocked the second half of the TARP funds and withstood an Obama veto.",

      "The claim, though, leaves listeners with the impression that Sanders' opposed bailing out the auto industry. But he voted in favor of providing auto companies with $14 billion, which was separate from the Wall Street bailout funds he opposed. That standalone measure failed.",

      "\"I'm going to give the same answer I've given for many months,\" Clinton replied. \"It wasn't the best choice. I made a mistake. It was not prohibited. It was not in any way disallowed, and as I've said and now has come out, my predecessors did the same thing, and many other people in the government.\"",
      "There's a couple problems with Clinton's talking point that her State Department predecessors used email practices similar to hers.",
      "First of all, there's the fact that most of Clinton's predecessors did not regularly use email. Just four former secretaries of state have held the job during the prominence of electronic communications: Clinton, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright.",
      "According to MSNBC, an aide for Albright said she \"did not use email while she was in office\" from 1997 to 2001. And Rice, head of the State Department from 2005-09, was not a habitual emailer either, according to multiple reports.",
      "So that leaves Powell, a regular email user, as Clinton's only predecessor who serves as a useful comparison. When we reached out to the Clinton campaign, they pointed us to Powell.",
      "Like Clinton, Powell used a personal email address. However, there's a big difference: Clinton hosted her email on a private server located in her home. Powell did not.",
      "Many politicians use private addresses, but private servers like the one Clinton used are rarely seen, said John Wonderlich, a policy director at the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan group focused on government transparency, for a prior PolitiFact story.",
      "And there's a big difference between a private account, which is generally free and simple to start, and a private server, which requires a more elaborate setup.",
      "The Atlantic speculated the Clintons \"may have wanted to be in control of the encryption of their correspondence, ensuring that no third parties whether commercial, hacker, or government were able to snoop on them.\"",
      "The unorthodox approach has opened up questions about her system's level of security.",
      "If the server was managed without the help of a third party, \"you would have to have a staff that's keeping up with all the latest fixes,\" said Clifford Neuman, director of the University of Southern California's Center for Computer System Security.",
      "We should note that the State Department has flagged a handful of emails containing information now deemed classified that were received by Powell and aides to Rice at private email addresses. In the more than 50,000 pages of Clinton emails the State Department has reviewed, just over 100 sent by Clinton have been deemed classified, according to a Washington Post analysis.",

Per the Iran deal, nuclear inspectors verified in January that Tehran was doing enough to curb its nuclear program, prompting the United States and other countries to lift the sanctions.",
      "Just how much money was being held up?",
      "Experts say $150 billion is the high end of estimates or, as Malloy put it, \"what it could possibly be in the broadest imagination.\" Most peg the the total value of Iranian assets at around $100 billion, but Iran probably still won't be able to access all of it.",
      "The deal only releases assets frozen because of Iran's nuclear program. Assets blocked because of other sanctions (on terrorism, human rights, and missile technology) won't change as a result of the agreement.",
      "Also, Iran won't suddenly have all the assets at its disposal because some of it is tied up in debts. For example, about $20 billion is obligated to China, which worked around the sanctions to finance infrastructure projects in Iran.",
      "The actual amount available to Iran is about $60 billion, estimates Garbis Iradian, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew pinned it at $56 billion, while Iranian officials say $35 billion, according to Richard Nephew, an expert on economic sanctions at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.",
      "In return, no bomb",
      "While the United States doesn't get a cash bonus for lifting sanctions, Trump's claim that we got \"nothing\" in return misses the point of the deal: blocking Iran from building a nuclear bomb.",
      "\"We got major restrictions and intrusive transparency on Iran's nuclear program. Beyond being not nothing,' this is the entire reason why we put the sanctions on in the first place,\" Nephew said. \"Reasonable people may disagree whether we got enough for the sanctions relief, but it wasn't nothing.\"",
      "\"There's a long list (of things we got), such that even the Israeli intelligence community has concluded that, for the duration of the deal, Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon,\" said George Perkovich, an expert on nuclear strategy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "Under the deal, Iran agreed to lose 97 percent of its stockpile of enriched uranium and give up 14,000 of its 20,000 centrifuges, which are needed to enrich uranium. It also agreed to curb production of plutonium (the other element that can be used to build a bomb) and dismantle its one plutonium reactor.",
      "To make sure Iran holds up its end of the bargain, the deal also permitted international inspectors to \"implement continuous monitoring.\" (What that means and whether it's enough are up for debate.) In other words, said Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Jim Walsh, we got Iran to nip its nuclear ambitions in the bud before the cash was released.",
      "Experts also pointed out that there's also a host of diplomatic advantages gained from the deal, such as the goodwill of the five other countries involved in the deal and potentially more cooperation from Iran in the Middle East.",
      "For example, the deal has \"reduced the chances of a war between Iran and Israel,\" and Iran \"could eventually de-escalate tensions with Saudi Arabia and contribute to a political settlement of the crisis in Syria,\" said Iradian.",

      "That's because, during torture, truth becomes irrelevant. And when the interrogators don't know if the information is true, the torture may continue even if the detainee tells the truth. At that point, the captive will fabricate information with the goal of telling the interrogator what he wants to hear.",

Special training programs designed to enhance that ability \"make the interrogators more confident that they can detect the truth, but in fact they would be better off flipping a coin.\"",
      "In the current war on terror, consider the case of Hassan Ghul. After his capture, he was cooperative without being tortured and provided information key to finding Osama bin Laden through bin Laden's associate, Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti. But after he cooperated, the CIA decided to torture Ghul anyway. It produced no useful additional intelligence.",

      "The committee's analysis of 20 prominent cases that reportedly \"saved lives\" cited by the CIA and the Bush administration found either that the key information was gathered before torture began, the information was already available to the intelligence community before the enhanced techniques were initiated, or there was no relationship between those success stories and the information provided by the detainees.",
      "For example, the majority report says that \"CIA records reveal that 34 percent of the 119 known CIA detainees produced no intelligence reports.\"",
      "Another example: The CIA said Ghul, the detainee who gave information that eventually led to the location of bin Laden, had been subjected to harsh interrogation and had produced valuable information. The agency neglected to mention that the information came before Ghul was subjected to enhanced interrogation.",
      "Other instances where the Bush administration said enhanced interrogation described by the president as tough, safe, lawful and necessary produced valuable intelligence have also been debunked.",

To meet equivalent standards when registering people on Election Day, same-day registration states require the voter to bring proper identification and proof of residency, such as a utility bill, with them to the polls.",
      "The specifics, though, vary by state because each state makes its own election laws. So if there are problems with ineligible voters using same-day registration, it likely has more to do with how the state implements the program, rather than a problem inherent to the general concept of same-day registration, said Barry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin.",
      "For example, some, but not all, states have an electronic database that they can use to check a same-day registrant's eligibility on the spot. Others, like Iowa and New Hampshire, send a mailer to all same-day registrants, and if the card is returned as undeliverable, the state will investigate the case as potential election fraud.",

      "For someone to vote fraudulently using same-day registration, they would have to lie about their eligibility in the presence of poll workers and others, and they would create a paper trail by filling out the paperwork. These factors serve as deterrents, in addition to the potentially severe penalties a fraudulent voter could face, like deportation if the person was in the country illegally.",
      "Burden pointed to a recent case in Wisconsin of a man who has been charged with election fraud for voting in the state's April 5 presidential primary. The man, who is not a citizen but is in the United States on a green card, registered and voted at the polls on Election Day. But the state government caught the man, and a spokesman for the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board told the local news that the agency had never encountered a similar case before, in 40 years of Election Day voter registration.",

      "Setting aside the bulk of Clinton's comments on protecting the Second Amendment (examples here, here, here, here, here and here), we'll now go over two points that some gun rights advocates and experts say gives Trump's charge some credence.",
      "Two smoking guns?",
      "Clinton riled the gun lobby with two eyebrow-raising comments last fall.",
      "Clinton said in October 2015 that a national gun buyback program like Australia's compulsory program was \"worth looking into.\" After a gunman killed 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in 1996, Australia banned semiautomatic and automatic weapons and enacted a mandatory buyback of the newly prohibited guns.",
      "That program is \"incompatible with private ownership of guns,\" said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "Dave Kopel, a pro-gun rights attorney and research director of the conservative Independence Institute in Denver, equates her musing about Australia's program as \"wanting to abolish the Second Amendment.\" (The NRA shares this view.)",
      "The full context of Clinton's response, however, suggests she may have misspoken or not fully understood Australia's program, as she also evoked voluntary buybacks as potential models for a U.S. program.",
      "\"Communities have done that in our country. Several communities have done gun buyback programs. But I think it would be worth considering on the national level if that could be arranged,\" she said, before comparing the buybacks to Cash for Clunkers, the Obama administration's voluntary vehicle trade-in program.",
      "Second, Clinton said she disagrees with the the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down Washington's handgun ban and recognized that the Second Amendment applies to the individual's right to bear arms.",
      "\"The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment,\" she said in a leaked recording of a private fundraiser.",
      "Volokh called the comment \"a smoking gun\" that bolsters Trump's charge. Reversing Heller, said Kopel, would be a huge blow to the individual right to bear arms",
      "They both pointed out that former Justice Department officials under President Bill Clinton and his appointees Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued in Heller that gun regulations do not violate the Second Amendment because it primarily pertains to a well-regulated militia and not the individual right to bear arms.",
      "Put both comments together, and Trump is correct, said NRA spokeswoman Amy Hunter.",
      "UCLA Second Amendment expert Adam Winkler, meanwhile, said that the accuracy of Trump's charge depends on Clinton's grounds for rejecting Heller. (According to news reports from the 2008 election, she supported Washington's handgun ban.)",
      "\"If she thought the reasoning was wrong, but the result right, then she would fit in with a number of strong pro-gun advocates,\" he said. \"If, however, she thought there should be no protection for gun rights, then Trump's claim comes closer to the truth.\"",
      "The Clinton campaign told us Clinton \"believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe.\"",
      "This suggests Clinton disagrees with the court declaring the district's ban on handguns unconstitutional, not necessarily the individual right itself a position that's more or less in line with the George W. Bush administration's position on Heller of recognizing the right but allowing reasonable curtailment.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said, \"Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment.\"",
      "We found no evidence of Clinton ever saying verbatim or suggesting explicitly that she wants to abolish the Second Amendment, and the bulk of Clinton's comments suggest the opposite. She has repeatedly said she wants to protect the right to bear arms while enacting measures to prevent gun violence.",
      "Gun advocates say Trump's claim is backed up by Clinton's openness to a gun buyback program and her disagreement with a Supreme Court decision on the Second Amendment. But whether or not these two cherry-picked comments actually reveal Clinton's intentions is a matter of interpretation.",
      "For this claim to hold water, the support for Second Amendment abolition needs to be more direct. So we rate it False."

      "After his GOP opponents dropped out of the race, Donald Trump was asked on NBC Nightly News if he would soften his opinions on immigration. \"As you try to appeal to the entire country, do you stand by them? Do you stand, for example, by the idea of a ban against foreign Muslims coming in?\" asked anchor Lester Holt.",
      "\"I do,\" said Trump. \"We have to be vigilant. We have to be strong. We have to see what's going on. There's a big problem in the world. You look what's happening with the migration in Europe. You look at Germany, it's crime-riddled right now.\"",
      "A reader asked us to check if Trump was accurately characterizing what is going on in Germany in the wake of the German government's willingness to accept migrants, particularly its decision in August to waive rules for Syrian refugees seeking sanctuary. About 1.1 million arrived last year from the Middle East, Asia and Africa.",
      "We emailed Trump's spokeswoman to ask for the source of his claim, but we didn't hear back.",
      "When something is riddled, it's filled with something undesirable. When a body is riddled with bullets, it has a lot of bullets. Without knowing the precise point at which a city is \"riddled\" with crime, we'll look at the data to see if Germany now has a lot of crime.",
      "Germany's crime rate, particularly violent crime, is far lower than in the United States. The U.S. murder rate, for example, is nearly six times higher than Germany's, according to the most recent report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.",
      "Government data show that despite a 440 percent increase in migrants, crime among that group only increased by 79 percent last year.",
      "We found out that the German government has repeatedly studied the question of crime and migrants.",
      "According to the Bundeskriminalamt, also known as the Federal Criminal Police Office or BKA, crimes by immigrants rose 79 percent in 2015.",
      "But at the same time, the number of refugees in the country rose more than fivefold by 440 percent.",
      "In other words, the typical German was more likely to engage in crime than the average migrant.",
      "Not only that, the BKA found that the increase was in the first half of 2015. The rate then leveled off during the second half of the year, the period with the greatest influx of refugees, according to the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle.",
      "Nonetheless, in terms of raw numbers, that's 92,000 more crimes committed by migrants than in previous years.",
      "Instances of assaults, robberies and \"predatory extortion,\" a classification that includes threatening behavior, doubled over 2015. Smaller offenses, such as theft (mostly shoplifting), forging paperwork to get money and riding on public transport without paying the fare, nearly doubled.",
      "According to Die Welt (The World), a national German newspaper, most of the crimes committed by refugees are related to theft or trying to ride on public transport without tickets. Fewer than 1 percent, or less than 1,000, are sex crimes, in spite of social media rumors.",
      "However, concern over sex crimes peaked New Year's Eve amid widespread reports of groups of drunken North African migrants Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco sexually assaulting hundreds of women in Cologne and other cities.",
      "Those reports dovetailed with a 2014 study that found 40 percent of refugees from that region had gotten into legal trouble within 12 months of their arrival versus 0.5 percent of Syrians. A later analysis also revealed that migrants from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan were much less likely to be charged with a crime than migrants from other regions such as the Western Balkans, demonstrating that you can't lump all migrants together.",
      "Groups concerned about the influx of migrants believe that the government may not be giving the full story.",
      "The reports that migrants are generating less crime than other Germans have been met with some criticism. Data from a few states were not included, for example, and the New Year's Eve sexual assaults didn't make it into the latest report.",
      "It should also be noted that some of the additional crime has consisted of attacks on migrants and migrant camps. By the end of October, the number of attacks against shelters for asylum seekers had tripled compared to the count for all of 2014.",
      "When we compared the U.S. State Department's annual reports on German crime and safety from 2014 to 2016, we found that the low-to-medium risk in 2014 had, by the 2015 report, risen to a medium rating for most cities.",
      "The 2016 report specifically mentions the refugee problem: \"While the 2014 statistics (the latest available) for Germany are of interest, they fail to capture any effect that the approximately 1 million refugees and asylum seekers who arrived in country in 2015 may have had on crime.\"",
      "It quotes some alarming statistics from the first quarter of 2015, but, as we've noted, the German government has released more up-to-date information that shows the initial refugee crime leveled off in the latter half of 2015.",
      "The crime and safety report also says, \"A number of ranking police officers have questioned the accuracy of the statistics being provided, specifically related to crimes taking place within refugee camps or being committed by refugees.\"",
      "But overall, \"To our knowledge, there have been no large-scale empirical studies that have shown a connection between large-scale immigration and spikes in crime. In fact many studies show the opposite,\" said Natalia Banulescu-Bogdan, assistant director of the international program at the Migration Policy Institute and a fellow at MPI Europe in Brussels.",
      "\"It is important to be very careful about causation versus correlation,\" she said. Youth unemployment, being forced to wait while seeking asylum or trying to reunite with family members can increase tensions, but conditions such as youth unemployment can spark crime among non-migrants as well.",
      "\"There is nothing to suggest, however, that there is anything specific to refugee populations in general, or to those seeking asylum in Europe in particular, that predisposes them to crime,\" said Banulescu-Bogdan. \"In fact the opposite is more likely to be true, because there is so much more riding on their ability to avoid encounters with police and jeopardize their future in the country.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said Germany \"is crime-riddled right now\" because of migration to Europe.",
      "There are more criminal acts in Germany these days because there are more people, thanks to the influx of 1.1 million refugees in 2015 alone.",
      "But the data suggest that the refugees tend to be better-behaved than the typical German. Even if you presume that refugee-related crime is underreported for political reasons, we could find no evidence in German media reports that the country warrants Trump's riddled-with-crime characterization.",
      "Because his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Meist Falsch Mostly False.",

      "At a rally in Cincinnati eight days before Election Day, Clinton explained how she and Trump differ on the issue of guns. The National Rifle Association endorsed Trump, and \"in return\" Trump has adopted various anti-gun control positions, she said.",
      "\"He's even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms,\" Clinton said. \"How can anyone think our schools would be safer with more guns?\"",
      "We wondered if Trump really has said he'd put allowing guns in classrooms at the top of his priorities list.",
      "Throughout the election, he has advocated for getting rid of gun-free zones at schools and military bases, arguing that this could prevent mass shootings in these types of locations. And he did say once during the primary that he would get rid of these zones on his first day in office.",
      "\"I will get rid of gun-free zones in schools, and you have to and on military bases, he said at a Jan. 7 rally in Vermont. \"On my first day, it gets signed, okay, my first day. There's no more gun-free zones.\"",
      "The Outdoor Channel asked Trump about this plan in an interview two weeks later.",
      "\"I'm going to get rid of gun-free zones on military bases and I'm also going to do it in schools,\" he said, adding that he would try to \"work with the states\" or \"perhaps override the states if I have to.\"",
      "The topic came up again in May, when Trump accepted the NRA's endorsement. In the days that followed, he waffled on whether he wants schools to allow guns on campus.",
      "In his May 20 speech accepting the endorsement, he said, \"We're getting rid of gun-free zones, okay. I can tell you that. We're getting rid of them.\"",
      "On May 21, Trump tweeted: \"Crooked Hillary said that I want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!\"",
      "He then made a seemingly contradictory claim on Fox News the next day, May 22: He doesn't advocate for guns in the classroom, but sometimes teachers should have guns in the classroom.",
      "\"I don't want to have guns in classrooms,\" he said. \"Although, in some cases, teachers should have guns in classrooms, frankly. Because teachers are, you know. Things that are going on in our schools are unbelievable. You look at some of our schools, unbelievable what's going on. But I'm not advocating guns in classrooms. But remember, in some cases, and a lot of people have made this case, teachers should be able to have guns. Trained teachers should be able to have guns in classrooms.\"",
      "We looked through other transcripts and interviews Trump has given since May, but we were unable to find further clarification about his position. His campaign did not respond to our request for comment.",
      "One final note: It's highly unlikely Trump could let people carry guns onto school property on his first day in office. Regulations against possessing or firing a gun in a school zone is written into federal law and would take congressional approval to overturn. Meanwhile, states have their own laws prohibiting guns in schools that would need to be repealed, as well.",

      "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has emphasized his promise to deport criminals living in the United States illegally with just a few days left before the election.",
      "In recent rallies in the swing states of Florida, North Carolina and Ohio, he recounted how Americans have been murdered by undocumented immigrants with criminal records.",
      "\"Thousands of Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants,\" Trump said Oct. 27 in Springfield, Ohio.",
      "He offered a range of anecdotes in different cities. In Springfield, Trump mentioned a 90-year-old Minnesota farmer \"brutally beaten by illegal immigrants and left to bleed to death in his home.\" In Kinston, N.C., Trump told the story of a 21-year-old \"viciously murdered in cold blood, shot point blank by an illegal immigrant with a long and vicious criminal record.\" In Tallahassee, Fla., Trump spoke about a 25-year-old shot dead by a man who had been deported four times and \"had a lengthy criminal record.\"",
      "We asked Trump's campaign for more details, wondering if the thousands of killings referred to specific years or regions. We did not get a response.",
      "We decided to look into the statement given the key role immigration has played this election season.",
      "Lack of data",
      "Immigration experts told us Trump's statement is so vague it is bound to be true.",
      "Without time or geographic parameters, the statement is just as accurate as saying \"thousands of Americans have been killed by men,\" said Charis E. Kubrin, a criminology professor at University of California, Irvine.",
      "The challenge in finding concrete numbers is due to a shortfall of data. There is no national database or study tracking how many people have been killed by undocumented immigrants or the nationality of the victims.",
      "About 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants accounted for about 3.5 percent of the total national population in 2014, according to Pew Research Center. Certainly some undocumented immigrants do commit violent crimes.",
      "\"The rate of murder may be lower or higher than other groups, but when we are talking about people, violent crime is never zero,\" said Steven Camarota, director of research at Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring strict immigration policies. \"By the same token it cannot be thousands every year. But adding up a few years then it has to be in the thousands.' There are a lot of murders in America and there are a lot illegal immigrants, so the statement has to be true.\"",
      "Overall, there are about 16,000 murders and 10,000 drunk driving deaths a year (the drunk driver is the person killed more than 60 percent of the time), Camarota said.",
      "Research on crime activity",
      "At his rallies, Trump portrays a picture of undocumented immigrants as a strong force of violent crime.",
      "Among the examples he offers is the fatal shooting of 32-year-old Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier in July 2015. Authorities said her killer was an immigrant in the country illegally who had been ordered deported five times.",
      "Some killings highlighted by Trump's campaign involved drunk driving incidents. Others went back more than a decade, according to a McClatchy review.",
      "McClatchy found that one of the killings Trump has mentioned dates back to 1990 and involved a man who was not in the country illegally, but a legal refugee originally from Vietnam. The man he shot, a police officer in California, ended up a paraplegic and died of cancer 12 years after being shot, McClatchy reported.",
      "While Trump's discourse suggests waves of immigrants equals violence, scholars say studies don't substantiate that message.",
      "Research on immigrants and crime finds that immigrants are not more likely than U.S.-born individuals to take part in crime, said Christopher P. Salas-Wright, an assistant professor at Boston University's School of Social Work.",
      "\"Again and again, we see evidence that they are not,\" Salas-Wright said. \"In fact, it's the opposite.\"",
      "Studies show that for the most part, people who migrate are a self-selecting group who want to better their lives, provide for their families back in their home countries and who don't want to risk getting in trouble with the law, said Kubrin, the criminology professor at University of California, Irvine.",
      "The American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit, analyzed data from the Census' 2010 American Community Survey and found that about 1.6 percent of immigrant males between 18 and 39 years old were incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born population in that same age group. (The Census does not specify legal status.)",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said, \"Thousands of Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants.\"",
      "Trump puts no timeframe on his comment, leaving his audience to fill in the blanks. In reality, there is no solid data for homicides committed by people here illegally. His implicit suggestion is that people should fear illegal immigrants more than citizens, and we don't see evidence for that. Research shows immigrants are less likely to engage in criminal behavior than the native-born population.",
      "However, like the legal U.S. population, some of the country's more than 11 million undocumented immigrants have committed murders. Trump's statement was open-ended enough that we rate it Half True.",

      "Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump in a campaign speech of wanting to reverse the landmark 2015 Supreme Court decision allowing same-sex marriage.",
      "During a Nov. 2, 2016, rally in Las Vegas, Clinton gave a laundry list of ideals she said Donald Trump opposed, including equal rights for LGBTQ members.",
      "\"If you care about LGBT rights, he wants to undo marriage equality,\" she said of the Republican presidential candidate. She repeated the claim hours later at a rally in Tempe, Ariz.",
      "Trump has spoken out against marriage equality before, but we wondered if he still held that view. While he's said gays and lesbians deserve protection under the law, he has also said he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would want to overturn the law.",
      "I am for traditional marriage'",
      "The first indication of Trump's feelings on same-sex marriage go back to an interview in The Advocate in 2000, when Trump was allegedly considering running for president.",
      "\"I think the institution of marriage should be between a man and a woman,\" Trump said. He added that he favored a domestic partnership law that would give same-sex couples the same legal benefits as married couples. (He voiced support for Elton John's 2005 civil union with David Furnish in a post on his now-defunct Trump University blog, however.)",
      "More than a decade later, in a March 2011 interview as he mulled a presidential run, Trump told Fox News host Bill O'Reilly that he was against marriage equality.",
      "\"I just don't feel good about it,\" Trump said. \"I don't feel right about it. I'm against it, and I take a lot of heat because I come from New York. You know, for New York it's like, how can you be against gay marriage? But I'm opposed to gay marriage.\"",
      "Two years later, Trump hedged a bit: \"I think I'm evolving, and I think I'm a very fair person, but I have been for traditional marriage. I am for traditional marriage, I am for a marriage between a man and a woman,\" he told MSNBC in 2013.",
      "Then Trump announced he really was running for president on June 16, 2015, and he quickly reiterated he didn't support marriage equality.",
      "After the U.S. Supreme Court ruling came out on June 26, Trump tweeted, \"Once again the Bush appointed Supreme Court Justice John Roberts has let us down. Jeb pushed him hard! Remember!\"",
      "Two days later, Trump told CNN's Jake Tapper on CNN that he was \"just for traditional marriage.\"",
      "Trump said the next month that he thought pushing a constitutional amendment that banned same-sex marriage would not be a realistic approach.",
      "But by October 2015, he began to indicate that he would seek to overturn the Obergefell vs. Hodges ruling that legalized same-sex marriage.",
      "\"We have some very terrible Supreme Court justices, and frankly, they should have at least had that as a state's right issue,\" he told CBN News. He also said he considered the ruling the law now.",
      "He told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace on Jan. 31, 2016, that he disagreed with the court's 5-4 decision.",
      "\"If I'm elected, I would be very strong on putting certain judges on the bench that I think maybe could change things,\" Trump said. \"They have ruled on it. I wish that it was done by the state. I don't like the way they ruled. I disagree with the Supreme Court from the standpoint they should have given the state it should be a states' rights issue. And that's the way it should have been ruled on, Chris, not the way they did it.\"",
      "Looking for a concise answer, Wallace asked Trump if he would \"try to appoint justices to overrule the decision on same-sex marriage.\"",
      "\"I could strongly consider that, yes,\" Trump said.",
      "His position didn't change during the litany of GOP primary debates, although he hasn't strongly reiterated how he wanted to appoint judges who would reverse the decision. In March 2016, he said at a Detroit debate that he agreed with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's opposition to the ruling.",
      "\"I would certainly have rather left it to the states,\" Trump said. \"I was very surprised when they came up with that decision. I would preferred it had been left to the states, and I think most people would have preferred that.\"",
      "Since then, Trump has said little about same-sex marriage. Trump's campaign didn't respond to our request for comment, and Clinton's spokesman didn't add any further comment. His stump speeches tend to avoid same-sex marriage, and we couldn't find any instance of a traditional media outlet directly asking him about it since the debates.",
      "When the GOP unveiled its party platform during this summer's Republican National Convention, which urged the reversal of \"the Supreme Court's redefinition of marriage,\" Trump's influence was downplayed.",
      "Trump \"has not really tried to weigh in on the platform,\" Wyoming Sen. John Barasso, the platform committee chairman, told NPR in July.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Clinton said Trump \"wants to undo marriage equality.\"",
      "While he's waffled slightly at times, Trump has said repeatedly that he supported \"traditional marriage.\" He also has said he would consider appointing Supreme Court justices that would reverse the 2015 ruling allowing same-sex marriage. He has not said much on the subject in recent months, other than to reiterate he felt it should have been a state-level decision. But he has not recanted his earlier views, either.",

      "While campaigning on Hillary Clinton's behalf, President Barack Obama has told people not to take their right to vote for granted, \"Don't boo, vote!\"",
      "At a Nov. 2 rally in North Carolina, Obama told the story of a 100-year-old woman from the town of Belhaven, N.C., whose voter registration status had been challenged by Republicans just a few weeks prior. The woman, Grace Bell Hardison, contested the challenge, and her county elections board upheld her status as a registered voter.",
      "\"And you better believe she's going to vote,\" Obama said. \"But this 100-year-old woman wasn't alone in being targeted. The list of voters Republicans tried to purge was two-thirds black and Democratic. That didn't happen by accident. It's happening in counties across the state. Now, there was a time when systematically denying black folks the right to vote was considered normal, as well.\"",
      "Two days after Obama spoke, a federal judge ordered three North Carolina counties to restore voter registrations for about 4,000 individuals whose registration had been revoked within 90 days of the election. The NAACP brought the lawsuit.",
      "Still, we were curious about Obama's claim that Republicans in North Carolina tried to purge a list of voters that was two-thirds black and Democratic.",
      "In his remarks, it was unclear if Obama was talking about the state as a whole or a smaller area. A spokesman told us that he was referring specifically to Belhaven, the town where Hardison lives.",
      "For the local area, Obama's numbers are close to on target, according to figures we received from the Beaufort County Elections Board.",
      "Ricky Radcliffe, a Republican who unsuccessfully ran for Belhaven mayor in 2015, and three of his associates submitted 138 voter registration challenges to the election board. Radcliffe had sent out mailers for his campaign to Belhaven residents based on voter registration information, and 138 of the mailers returned as undeliverable, so he and his associates contested their registration status.",
      "Of these 138 people who had their voter registrations challenged, 80 were black Democrats. That's about 58 percent just shy of the two-thirds Obama said.",
      "It appears that black people were at least slightly overrepresented in this group; black people of all political parties make up about 66 percent all the Belhaven challenged voters. But the town of Belhaven overall is about 54 percent black.",
      "We don't have city-level political party data for Belhaven, so we can't know if Democrats were overrepresented, too.",
      "Obama used this case to support his claim that Republicans are stopping black Democrats from voting in counties \"all around the state\" of North Carolina.",
      "Of North Carolina's 100 counties, just three were involved in the most recent legal proceedings over voter roll purges: Beaufort, which we already discussed, Moore and Cumberland.",
      "Moore County removed 374 voters from the rolls, and 14.4 percent were black Democrats. Black people of all parties made up about 18 percent of the removed voters and 14 percent of the Moore County population overall.",
      "Jay Delancy, director of the Voter Integrity Project, an anti-voter fraud advocacy group that brought the challenges in Moore County, told us that his group strips out race and party when it looks for potentially fraudulent voter registrations in order to avoid bias.",
      "We were unable to get data from Cumberland County in time for publication.",
      "We were, though, able to get data for North Carolina overall. The state elections board told us that there were 6,612 total voters removed from the rolls in 2016, though many were re-added due to the recent court order. A plurality of those removed, 25.7 percent, were black Democrats. For comparison, white Republicans accounted for 18.44 percent.",

The first entry in Google's news category -- above those from news links to the Washington Post and Politico -- was a Nov. 12 post (updated the following day) from a little-known site called 70news.",
      "\"Final election 2016 numbers: Trump won both popular (62.9M-62.2M) and Electoral College Votes (306-232),\" the post's headline said.",
      "",
      "Further down the page, the site's anonymous author wrote, \"To all the liberal loonies still rioting because you claim Trump did not get the popular vote, get your meds now and prepare to be shocked because the finals results are in. Trump got 306 Electoral College vote while Hillary Clinton got 232. For #PopularVote: #Trump: 62,972,226 #Clinton: 62,277,750.\"",
      "According to its Facebook page, the site launched in August and seeks to \"share news that matters to you. What liberal media will try to hide, we will uncover.\"",
      "Here's a screenshot of how that particular Google search displayed the 70news post -- prominently.",
      "",
      "The most comprehensive vote-tracking analysis is published by David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. As of 2:30 p.m. on Nov. 14, according to Wasserman's calculations, Clinton led Trump by 784,748 votes -- specifically, 61,422,098 for Clinton, 60,637,350 for Trump, and 6,691,311 for other candidates.",
      "Other tallies showed similar results. CNN at that time showed a Clinton-over-Trump margin of 668,059, while the Associated Press had a margin of 668,483. (Different media outlets may report different numbers at a given time because of delays in obtaining and uploading new data.)",
      "Here's CNN's tally by mid-day Nov. 14, showing Clinton ahead by half a percentage point.",
      "",
      "And given the votes left to be counted, it's almost impossible to imagine that Trump will gain back ground in the coming days.",
      "That's because California -- a state where Clinton is beating Trump by a 62 percent-33 percent margin -- has the most votes still to count of any state. Nearly a week after the election, CNN estimates that only 70 percent of the California vote had been counted. In addition, only 87 percent of the vote in Oregon had been counted; Clinton beat Trump 52 percent-41 percent there. And Washington state had counted only 87 percent of its vote; Clinton beat Trump there by a 55 percent-38 percent margin.",
      "So it's entirely plausible that Clinton could end up winning the popular vote by 1 million to 1.5 million votes -- roughly two or three times the popular-vote margin assembled by Al Gore when he lost the Electoral College, and the presidency, to George W. Bush in 2000.",
      "By Nov. 14, the Washington Post and Business Insider both posted articles questioning why Google still had the 70news article at the top of their news category. A Google representative said the company was looking into the issue.",
      "And on Nov. 14, 70news posted an update: \"Anyone asking where I got the figures, it was from twitter posts. If I'm wrong, I won't hesitate to change the numbers. It's the job of the establishment media to tell the people the final numbers when it's out there already.\" (The Twitter post cited by 70News was this one.)",

      "\"The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?\" Trump tweeted Nov. 13.",
      "The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?",
      "Trump's tweet is a distorted and over-the-top description of a Nov. 13 letter to readers from the New York Times' publisher and executive editor.",
      "The 200-word letter primarily serves to thank readers for their loyalty and to say that New York Times will \"rededicate\" itself to the high journalistic standards it has employed thus far.",
      "Nowhere in the letter did the authors write anything like an apology. Nor did they say that the organization's overall coverage of Trump was \"bad.\"",
      "Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said Trump was referring to the fact that the letter includes an admission that the New York Times underestimated Trump's chances. The letter said the outcome was \"unexpected\" and posed the rhetorical question: \"Did Donald Trump's sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?\"",
      "At times during the election, the New York Times presidential poll forecast predicted Hillary Clinton had more than a 90 percent chance of winning the election, and that turned out to be incorrect.",
      "\"Doesn't that speak volumes about the coverage?\" Cheung said of the inaccurate predictions at the New York Times and elsewhere. \"It wasn't just a disservice to President-elect Trump, but it's also a disservice to the voters looking for reliable coverage which they obviously didn't get during the election.\"",
      "But predictions and polling are just two aspects of the New York Times' Trump coverage throughout the campaign season.",
      "They also broke the story that he likely didn't pay federal income taxes for years, on top of stories about women who claimed Trump groped them. On the other side, the New York Times also broke the news that Clinton used a private email server.",
      "The letter from publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and executive editor Dean Baquet praised the organization's work overall. It said reporters consistently covered the election \"with agility and creativity\" and that they will cover the new president with \"the same fairness, the same level of scrutiny, the same independence\" that they already do.",
      "So it's a stretch to say the letter's line about an inaccurate prediction is an admission of \"bad coverage\" of Trump overall, nor is it an apology.",
      "A spokeswoman for the New York Times told PolitiFact: \"We're incredibly proud of our coverage of the 2016 campaign. There was no suggestion either in our note to staff, or the note to subscribers, that we were apologizing.\"",
      "Certainly, the New York Times and other media outlets are reflecting on their coverage from the year and why they so underestimated Trump's support. The New York Times public editor Liz Spayd, for example, wrote Nov. 9 that reporters could have done more to immerse themselves in Trump supporters' lives.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said, \"The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me.\"",

      "But the story doesn't have anything to do with ABC News, and it doesn't have anything to do with the Associated Press. It is 100 percent fake.",
      "",
      "It was created by Paul Horner, who posts fake news on a variety of websites. Some of his posts go viral, presumably boosting his standing with Google's news algorithm. The fake news posts typically earn Horner -- according to an interview with the Washington Post -- $10,000 a month in ad sales.",
      "In the Post interview, Horner took credit for the fake news item about the protester being paid $3,500.",
      "\"His followers don't fact-check anything they'll post everything, believe anything,\" Horner said. Referring to then-Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Horner said, \"His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist.\" Here's a screenshot of Lewandowski's since-deleted tweet:",

I've gone to Trump protests trust me, no one needs to get paid to protest Trump. I just wanted to make fun of that insane belief, but it took off. They actually believed it.\"",
      "The story's high position on Google search results after the election likely stems from Horner's decision to re-date the post, which originally ran in March. The current version is dated Nov. 11.",
      "Automated algorithms may not be able to tell fact from fiction, but a human with minimal understanding of typical news articles might have noticed, after clicking into it, that the article eventually degenerates into a rant against Snopes.com, the urban-legends site that has regularly debunked articles from websites operated by Horner.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump provoked a firestorm on social media with a series of tweets on Nov. 27 that questioned the integrity of the balloting that elected him president.",
      "In one tweet, Trump wrote, \"In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\"",
      "In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally",
      "He later tweeted, \"Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!\"",
      "These tweets offer a cornucopia of assertions we've already debunked, including the notion that Trump won the Electoral College in a \"landslide\" (False), that he won the popular vote (Pants on Fire), and that 3 million votes were cast by illegal aliens (False).",
      "We found zero evidence for Trump's charge that he \"won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,\" and a lot of reasons to conclude that it didn't happen.",
      "The current status of the vote",
      "Almost three weeks after Election Day, the ballots are mostly but not entirely counted.",
      "The most comprehensive vote-tracking analysis is published by David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. As of noon on Nov. 28, according to Wasserman's calculations, Hillary Clinton led Trump by roughly 2.24 million votes -- specifically, 64,654,483 for Clinton, 62,418,820 for Trump, and 7,192,036 for other candidates.",
      "Late ballot tabulations in some states are still trickling in -- many of them states, such as California, where Clinton fared overwhelmingly well. For this reason, Wasserman tweeted on Nov. 26 that Clinton seems to be on track to win the popular vote by 2.5 million to 2.7 million votes, or a margin of about 2 percentage points over Trump.",
      "So to erase Trump's popular-vote deficit, there would need to be almost 3 million votes for Clinton that were cast illegally. And that assumes that all 3 million of these \"illegal votes\" went to Clinton and not a single one went to Trump.",
      "That's a really big number. For a sense of scale, 3 million votes is more than were cast for any presidential candidate in 36 states plus the District of Columbia. And 3 million people is more than a quarter of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States a group that InfoWars specifically singled out as the source of 3 million illegal votes.",
      "A lack of evidence",
      "As we've previously noted, conspiracy-minded websites notably Alex Jones' InfoWars have posted articles claiming that 3 million votes in the presidential election were \"cast by illegal aliens.\" We rated that False.",
      "As evidence of its claim, InfoWars' headline referred to a report from VoteFraud.org and tweets from Gregg Phillips, whose Twitter profile says he's the founder of VoteStand, a voter fraud reporting app.",
      "However, there is no report from VoteFraud.org, and Phillips told PolitiFact he is not affiliated with that website. Tweets by Phillips on Nov. 11 and Nov. 13 said that \"we have verified more than 3 million votes cast by non-citizens\" and that Phillips had \"completed analysis of database of 180 million voter registrations. Number of non-citizen votes exceeds 3 million. Consulting legal team.\"",
      "Phillips has not responded to PolitiFact's queries for additional information. He told us previously that he has chosen not to release more information because he is still working on analyzing the data and verifying its accuracy. Phillips would not say what the data is or where it came from, or what methodology he used. He said he would release the information publicly once he is finished.",
      "On a Nov. 28 conference call with reporters, Trump spokesman Jason Miller mentioned two pieces of evidence that Trump had also cited earlier in the campaign. One was a 2012 Pew Center on the States study whose author denies that it found any evidence of voter fraud. The other was a 2014 article posted on the Monkey Cage blog hosted by the Washington Post; it prompted multiple articles by other political scientists casting doubt on its accuracy. In any case, neither study offers analysis of the 2016 electoral returns.",
      "True the Vote, a group that has argued that election fraud is widespread, gave Trump's comment rhetorical support but did not provide specific evidence.",
      "Backing from elected Republicans was scarce. One GOP senator, James Lankford of Oklahoma, said on CNN's New Day, \"I don't know what (Trump) was talking about on that one.\" He added that while there may be irregularity \"on the edges,\" he has \"not seen any voter irregularity in the millions.\"",
      "Voter fraud uncommon",
      "Other research suggests that voter fraud is not widespread.",
      "News21, a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found just 56 cases of noncitizens voting between 2000 and 2011.",
      "A report by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law found that most cases of noncitizens voting were accidental. \"Although there are a few recorded examples in which noncitizens have apparently registered or voted, investigators have concluded that they were likely not aware that doing so was improper,\" reads the 2007 report.",
      "In 2012, Florida Gov. Rick Scott's administration started an effort trying to crack down on noncitizens voting by comparing driver's license data against voter rolls. The Florida Department of State created a list of 182,000 potential noncitizens that had voted. That number was whittled down to 2,700, then to about 200 before the purge was stopped amid criticism that the data was flawed given the number of false positives including a Brooklyn-born World War II vet. Ultimately, only 85 people were removed from the rolls.",
      "Meanwhile, ProPublica, an investigative journalism project, tweeted that \"we had 1,100 people monitoring the vote on Election Day. We saw no evidence the election was rigged' \" and \"no evidence that undocumented immigrants voted illegally.\"",
      "Experts unconvinced",
      "Experts dismissed the substance of Trump's tweet.",
      "\"This is patently false,\" said Costas Panagopoulos, a Fordham University political scientist. \"There would need to be a massive national conspiracy and coordination effort to do this, and illegal aliens would need to be on the voter rolls in states across the country months earlier to be eligible to vote. It is also very convenient the estimated fraudulent vote is just enough to give Trump the popular vote. Not likely a coincidence.\"",
      "Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz added, \"If Mr. Trump seriously believes that there was significant vote fraud in any state, he should file a formal protest and ask for an investigation. He does not he is simply repeating baseless claims.\"",
      "And University of Denver political scientist Seth Masket said the claim is short on basic logic.",
      "\"It's bizarre to claim that Clinton had the ability to generate millions of illegal voters but not use them to help her win the Electoral College,\" Masket said.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump tweeted that he \"won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\"",
      "Neither Trump nor his allies have presented any evidence of widespread illegal voting. In reality, studies have consistently shown that voter fraud is nowhere near common enough to call into question millions and millions of votes.",
      "Indeed, the ability to carry off such a far-reaching conspiracy potentially involving millions of people over the course of several months and without being noticed by election administration officials, many of them in states controlled by Republicans is ridiculously illogical. We rate Trump's statement Pants on Fire.",

      "In the vice presidential debate, Republican Mike Pence tried to skewer Hillary Clinton by talking about the multi-billion dollar Clinton Foundation. Pence recycled a flawed GOP talking point that the foundation is a cash cow to enrich the Clintons and their friends.",
      "\"10 cents on the dollar from the Clinton Foundation goes to charitable causes,\" Pence said.",
      "This is based on a misunderstanding of how the foundation operates. In brief, it raises money to deliver services and projects itself. The amount of money it gives away as grants is a small sliver of its activities.",
      "We'll use the Clinton Foundation's most recent IRS tax form, for 2014, as an example. (It starts on Page 28 of this document.) The foundation reported total expenses in 2014 of a little over $91 million but grants of just $5.1 million. That's close to 6 percent of the foundation's money being spent on grants.",
      "But that doesn't mean everything else is overhead, people who monitor charities and their practices say, or that only 10 cents of every dollar went to a charitable cause.",
      "\"Although it has foundation' in its name, the Clinton Foundation is actually a public charity,\" Brian Mittendorf, a professor of accounting at Ohio State University's Fisher College of Business, wrote in the Chronicle of Philanthropy. \"In practical terms, this means both that it relies heavily on donations from the public and that it achieves its mission primarily by using those donations to conduct direct charitable activities, as opposed to providing grants from an endowment.\"",
      "What are some of the foundation's programs?",
      "The Clinton Development Initiative helps farmers in Malawi, Rwanda and Tanzania raise more crops and get higher prices at the market.",
      "The Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership launched the Acceso Centro de Formacion to provide job training for people in Cartagena, Colombia.",
      "The Clinton Health Access Initiative, for instance, has gotten credit for providing access to lower-cost drugs for millions of people with HIV/AIDS.",
      "Financial statement rules require a nonprofit to split its expenses between program services, fundraising and management/general costs (the latter two are collectively what are referred to as \"overhead\"), Mittendorf told us.",
      "He said that in 2014, 87.2 percent of the Clinton Foundation's expenses were on program services.",
      "\"Of course, this only speaks to how the organization used its funds and not whether that 87.2 percent was allocated to the most effective program efforts, but it is all we have in terms of verifiable data on this question,\" Mittendorf said.",
      "The American Institute of Philanthropy's Charity Watch, reached the same conclusion. It has given the Clinton Foundation an A rating and says it spends only 12 percent of the money it raises on \"overhead.\"",
      "\"The Clinton Foundation is an excellent charity,\" Charity Watch president Daniel Borochoff said Aug. 24, 2016, on CNN. \"They are able to get 88 percent of their spending to bona fide program services and their fundraising efficiency is really low. It only costs them $2 to raise $100.\"",
      "Other Republican critics of the foundation have used slightly higher figures than Pence. Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus said the foundation only spent 20 percent on good works. Conservative radio talker Rush Limbaugh said it was 15 percent. Those are inaccurate, too.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Pence said 10 cents on every dollar from the Clinton Foundation goes to charitable causes. While it's true that the foundation gives away in grants a small fraction of its resources, about 87 percent of its expenses go toward services it provides directly.",
      "A leading expert in the finances of philanthropies, Mittendorf, says that while the Clinton Foundation calls itself a foundation, it operates like a public charity. Mittendorf cautioned that while the dollar amounts are clear and verified, that is no guarantee that the programs are effective and efficient. However, that is not the criticism Pence raised.",

      "\"Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014, and he said, If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes,' \" Kaine charged. \"He's broken his first \"",
      "\"And he will,\" Pence interjected.",
      "\"He's broken his first promise,\" Kaine insisted.",
      "\"He hasn't broken his promise,\" Pence said. \"Look, Donald Trump has filed over 100 pages of financial disclosure, which is what the law requires. The American people can review that. And he's going -- senator, he's going to release his tax returns when the audit is over.\"",
      "\"Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit,\" Kaine countered accurately, before the moderator directed the discussion to Social Security.",
      "Kaine was referencing a 2014 interview Trump did with Irish TV. While he didn't use those exact words, Kaine's quote is largely accurate. That was before Trump was actually running for president.",
      "But Trump has said he would release his tax returns multiple times since annoucning his candidacy as well.",
      "\"Will you release any of your tax returns for the public to scrutinize?\" NBC's Chuck Todd asked Trump in January 2016.",
      "\"Well, we're working on that now. I have very big returns, as you know, and I have everything all approved and very beautiful and we'll be working that over in the next period of time, Chuck. Absolutely,\" Trump replied.",
      "A few weeks later, Trump told the Today Show in February 2016 that he'll release his tax returns \"probably over the next few months.\"",
      "Since those comments, Trump has repeated the promise but with conditions. Recently, he's said he would release them once Clinton releases all of her emails. And as Pence mentioned, Trump has said repeatedly he has yet to do so because an ongoing IRS audit. (He's also suggested he probably won't before election day.)",
      "According to his tax attorneys, Trump has been \"under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service since 2002.\" But he's also promised to release his tax returns without this condition and, presumably, while under audit in 2011, 2014 and 2015.",
      "As Buzzfeed reported, Trump suggested he'd \"love\" to release his tax returns in 2011, when he was flirting with a presidential bid and questioning Barack Obama's birthplace.",
      "\"Maybe I'm going to do the tax returns when Obama does his birth certificate,\" Trump said in an April 18, 2011, interview with ABC. \"I may tie my tax returns, I'd love to give my tax returns, I may tie my tax returns into Obama's birth certificate.\"",
      "When the White House released Obama's birth certificate a week later, Trump told ABC he would fulfill his pledge and release his tax records \"at the appropriate time.\"",
      "A few years later, Trump had yet to release his tax returns, prompting an Irish television host to ask him about it in a May 2014 interview.",
      "\"You questioned his citizenship during his campaign, and you said afterwards if he produced that long-form birth certificate, you'd produce your tax returns. But you didn't do it, did you?\" asked TV3's Colette Fitzpatrick.",
      "\"Well I don't know, did he do it?\" Trump said. \"If I decide to run for office, I'll produce my tax returns, absolutely and I would love to do that.\"",
      "Trump also repeatedly agreed to release his tax returns in a February 2015 interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt.",
      "If he ran for president, Trump said, \"I would release tax returns and I'd also explain to people that as a person that's looking to make money you know, I'm in the business of making money until I do this and if I won, I would make money for our country.\"",
      "\"How many years back?\" Hewitt asked. \"Three years, five years?\"",
      "\"The answer is I would do it. But I will tell you upfront, as a private person, and I'm very proud of this, I want to pay as little taxes as I can as a private person,\" Trump said.",
      "\"Of course. That's the American way. Legally,\" Hewitt agreed. \"But how many years back would you go back? Three, five?",

They've been really doing one year other than people that never made anything. But I would certainly I'm very proud of what I've done. I do pay tax, but I'm very proud of what I've done,\" Trump said. \"I have no objection to showing any tax return.\"",

And if you ever noticed the Canadians -- when they need a big operation when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow, it's catastrophic in certain ways. But, she wants to go to single payer which means the government basically rules everything.\"",
      "Does Clinton want to move the United States to a single-payer system for health care?",
      "Clinton's health care plan",
      "Converting Obamacare to a single-payer program would make it, like Medicare, a federal health insurance program run by the federal government. Under a single-payer system, the government provides health care for everyone. Currently, Obamacare promotes policies supplied by private insurance companies.",
      "Some Democrats including, at one time, Barack Obama pushed for a single-payer system. But there wasn't enough support for that, and ultimately Congress approved a plan that allows different insurance plans offered in \"marketplaces\" by individual states and the federal government.",
      "During the vice presidential debate, Trump's running mate Gov. Mike Pence made a similar claim that Clinton and and Tim Kaine \"want to expand (Obamacare) into a single-payer program.\" We rated that claim Mostly False. For our fact-check of Pence, Trump spokesman Dan Kowalski pointed us to the health care page on Clinton's website.",
      "It indicates \"that she supports a 'public option' for Obamacare,\" Kowalski said. \"A 'public option' is a single-payer-like option for health care delivery.\"",
      "Here is exactly what she said on her campaign website about a public option:",
      "\"Defend and expand the Affordable Care Act, which covers 20 million people. Hillary will stand up to Republican-led attacks on this landmark law and build on its success to bring the promise of affordable health care to more people and make a \"public option\" possible. She will also support letting people over 55 years old buy into Medicare.\"",
      "So Clinton does want a public option, but she is calling for adding the public option to the existing options.",
      "Clinton has consistently said, including during the Oct. 9 debate, that she wants to protect Obamacare from being repealed by the Republicans.",
      "She has called for expanding it to include tax credits, eliminating the out-of-network hospital charges many plans levy, and reducing prescription drug costs by removing the ban that prevents the federal government from negotiating drug prices and allowing Americans to important their drugs from countries with cheaper prices.",
      "We previously asked the Trump campaign if they had seen any statements from Clinton or Kaine indicating that converting Obamacare into a single-payer system was their eventual goal.",
      "Kowalski responded that \"Hillary has committed fully to the public option,\" and as evidence he directed us to comments Clinton made in 1994 when she was first lady.",
      "At the time, she predicted that if Congress didn't pass health care reform soon, \"I believe, and I may be totally off base on this, but I believe that by the year 2000 we will have a single-payer system. I don't think it's I don't even think it's a close call politically.\"",

      "A few days after the vice presidential debate, WikiLeaks published emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.",
      "A Jan. 25 email from Clinton campaign research director Tony Carrk to Podesta contained excerpts of Clinton's paid speeches to Wall Street banks. (For months Clinton has faced calls to release the speeches but hasn't done so.)",
      "One excerpt related to single-payer systems was from remarks she gave to \"ECGR Grand Rapids\" on June 17, 2013. She gave a speech to the Economic Club of Grand Rapids in Michigan that day.",
      "\"If you look at countries that are comparable, like Switzerland or Germany, for example, they have mixed systems. They don't have just a single-payer system, but they have very clear controls over budgeting and accountability. If you look at the single-payer systems, like Scandinavia, Canada, and elsewhere, they can get costs down because, you know, although their care, according to statistics, overall is as good or better on primary care, in particular, they do impose things like waiting times, you know. It takes longer to get like a hip replacement than it might take here.\"",
      "We can't fully evaluate Clinton's speech because WikiLeaks published only excerpts. (We asked the Clinton campaign for a fully copy but did not get a response to that request.) However, Clinton praised single-payer because she says it keeps costs down, but she also said that it imposes wait times. And she also praised systems like Switzerland for having clear budget controls and said they don't have single payer.",
      "Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin sent us a brief fact-check in Politico that was headlined: \"No, Clinton has not been after single payer for years.\"",
      "One final note: Trump has been all over the map on single-payer health care if we trace his comments back to his first race for president in 2000.",
      "\"The Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than America. We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing,\" Trump wrote in his 2000 book The America We Deserve.",
      "Other times in the past couple of years he has praised it, but he has also said he doesn't support it. His campaign plan on his website emphasizes \"free market principles.\"",

But we also want to reach out to the vast majority of American Muslims and Muslims around this country, this world, to help us defeat this threat, which is so evil and has got to be denounced by everyone, regardless of religion.\"",

There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.\"",

      "What we found is that Hillary Clinton has been accused of threatening or shaming accusers of Bill Clinton. But all the accusations remain unproven, as do the specific allegations against Bill Clinton. In most cases, evidence Hillary Clinton intervened in any significant way doesn't exist.",
      "An error in Trump's counting",
      "Before we explain the case with each accuser, a small note. While Trump invited four women to the debate at Washington University in St. Louis, only three of them -- Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones -- accuse Bill Clinton of sexual assault.",
      "The fourth woman, Kathy Shelton, was a victim in a rape case. Hillary Clinton defended Shelton's attacker while working at a University of Arkansas legal aid clinic. You can read our fact-check related to that incident here.",
      "Hillary Clinton and Juanita Broaddrick",
      "In 1978, Juanita Broaddrick managed a nursing home in Arkansas. During the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, Broaddrick came forward to say that he had raped her in her hotel room in 1978.",
      "Broaddrick also said that she believed Hillary Clinton knew about the rape and tried to intervene.",
      "She described an encounter to the conservative website Breitbart. Broaddrick said that soon after the alleged event took place, she went to a Democratic fundraiser that the Clintons attended. Broaddrick said Hillary Clinton approached her.",
      "Clinton said, \"I just want you to know how much Bill and I appreciate the things you do for him. Do you understand? Everything you do,\" Broaddrick recounted.",
      "Broaddrick told Breitbart, \"What really went through my mind at that time is She knows. She knew. She's covering it up and she expects me to do the very same thing.'\"",
      "Broaddrick did not go public with her story, even going so far as to deny that the rape occurred in a sworn deposition (as part of the Paula Jones case). Two decades later though, investigators with independent counsel Ken Starr approached her and she told it all. Ultimately, Starr's team decided there was \"inconclusive evidence\" to press charges.",
      "We found no evidence of Hillary Clinton viciously attacking Broaddrick, as Trump claimed, nor is there independent confirmation of the exchange at the fundraising event. Also, in a 1999 interview with NBC News, Broaddrick was asked if Bill Clinton or anyone close to him had ever done anything to keep her silent. Broaddrick said, \"No.\"",
      "Kathleen Willey",
      "In 1993, Kathleen Willey was a Clinton supporter and a volunteer at the White House. Willey said that when she went to the president to ask for a paid position, he groped her.",
      "Willey, now a Trump supporter, has said that Hillary Clinton \"wrote the book on terrorizing women.\" Willey described what she believed to be efforts to intimidate her in an interview with the conservative website Daily Caller.",
      "That list included \"a dead cat found on her porch, a man she saw at night under her deck, and a stranger in her remote neighborhood inquiring threateningly about how her children were doing.\"",
      "Willey also mentioned being told that Clinton insider Sidney Blumenthal said about her, \"She may look good today she's not going to look good by Friday.\"",
      "In the course of responding to a lawsuit in 1999, Blumenthal did say Hillary Clinton played some sort of role in the White House response to Willey's allegations. She approved the public release of letters Willey had sent after the alleged event. The letters were characterized as \"friendly\" and, according to Blumenthal, Clinton thought they would undermine Willey's credibility because the tone was at odds with the episode she described.",
      "We reached out to Willey to get more details but have yet to hear back.",
      "Paula Jones",
      "In 1994, Arkansas state worker Paula Jones accused Bill Clinton of making an unwanted sexual advance. Clinton ultimately paid $850,000 to settle with Jones without admitting guilt.",
      "Jones has harsh words for Hillary Clinton. She said Clinton was out to discredit her.",
      "\"She don't care nothing about women. Because if she did she would believe what I had to say,\" Jones told Breitbart.",
      "Jones said Clinton was an enabler of her husband's transgressions. After Jones sued Bill Clinton, his legal team questioned her and looked into her background.",
      "But, again, we found no evidence Hillary Clinton attacked Jones. The closest was in 1998 when Clinton said she felt that Jones' lawsuit was part of a larger political agenda.",
      "Other allegations",
      "Long-time Washington journalist Carl Bernstein wrote in his biography of Hillary Clinton A Woman in Charge that in the 1992 campaign Hillary Clinton directed a special \"defense team\" to deal with allegations about \"Bill's history with the Selective Service System, women claiming to have had affairs with him, and other personal aspects of the Clintons' lives.\"",
      "One aide was sent to Little Rock, Ark., to dig for facts about the most worrying revelation from Gennifer Flowers, a woman who claimed to have had a long affair with Bill Clinton. The campaign hired a detective to look into the backgrounds of any women who had come forward.",
      "The Trump campaign pointed to a New York Times article that described the work of that detective. The newspaper reported that in a memo, the detective said he would impugn Flowers' \"character and veracity until she is destroyed beyond all recognition.\"",
      "Importantly, however, while Flowers claimed she had an affair with Bill Clinton, she did not claim she was abused.",
      "In a 1992 interview, Clinton herself called Flowers \"some failed cabaret singer who doesn't even have much of resume to fall back on.\" And on another occasion, she said if she had the chance to cross-examine Flowers, she \"would crucify her.\"",
      "But the same New York Times article quotes a statement provided earlier this month by the Hillary Clinton campaign from James Carville, the 1992 campaign's top strategist.",
      "\"Hillary wanted us to defend the governor against attacks,\" the statement said. \"It's just ridiculous to imagine that she was somehow directing our response operation. That was my job, not hers.\"",
      "ABC News host George Stephanopoulos served as the communications director in Clinton's 1992 campaign. Stephanopoulos wrote in All Too Human, that when Connie Hamzy, one of the first women to claim a sexual encounter with Bill, came forward Hillary said, \"We have to destroy her story.\"",
      "Hamzy said Bill Clinton propositioned her, but she didn't object.",
      "Lastly, no account of Bill Clinton's transgressions would be complete without mentioning one-time White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Lewinsky aimed to get the attentions of the president and succeeded. When Lewinsky's story came to light through the Starr investigation, Hillary Clinton forcefully rejected that there was any truth to it.",
      "Clinton basically wrote it off as part of \"this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.\"",
      "When Hillary Clinton said that, Lewinsky was still publicly denying her affair with the president.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said that Hillary Clinton \"viciously\" attacked women who accused Bill Clinton of abuse.",
      "Bill Clinton certainly has been accused of sexual assault and having affairs. The record shows Hillary Clinton played a role in defending her husband, and that the Clintons' first presidential campaign deployed tough tactics to defend against stories of consensual sex.",
      "But in the cases of alleged abuse by Broaddrick, Willey and Jones, Hillary Clinton was largely silent. The words she allegedly had with Broaddrick are subject to interpretation. Approving the release of Willey's letters does qualify as an attack, but using a person's words against them is a fairly tame tactic. And Clinton did not attack Jones directly.",
      "Overall, we rate the claim Mostly False."

      "Donald Trump returned to a topic he's been citing often in recent months -- rising crime.",
      "\"We have a very divided nation,\" he said. \"You look at Charlotte. You look at Baltimore. You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities. Chicago. You take a look at Washington, D.C. We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.\"",
      "Trump is largely on target that \"we have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.\"",
      "His staff didn't respond to an inquiry, but Trump seems to be referring to a set of annual statistics released by the FBI. The most recent report came out in September.",
      "Those statistics showed that the number of murders and non-negligent homicides rose nationally between 2014 and 2015 by 10.8 percent. When we checked the numbers, we confirmed that this increase does rank as the biggest year-to-year jump in murders since 1970-71, when the number rose by 11.1 percent. That was exactly 45 years ago.",
      "In fact, Trump's debate comment was stated more accurately than what one of his key surrogates -- former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani -- said earlier in the day on Meet the Press. Giuliani stated that \"last year, crime went up more than in the last 41 years.\"",
      "Not only did Giuliani get the number of years wrong, but he also referred to \"crime\" generally, not to murders specifically. And that makes a difference. Violent crime did go up between 2014 and 2015, but by a significantly smaller percentage than murders did -- 3.9 percent. That rate of increase was smaller than several year-to-year increases since 1971, most recently an increase between 1989 and 1990 of 10.6 percent. In addition, between 2014 and 2015, property crime actually dropped by 2.6 percent.",
      "So Trump has a fair point. Still, we'll note two caveats.",
      "First, his terminology was imperfect. The 10.8 percent increase represents an overall national figure -- not the figure for murders \"within our cities,\" as Trump phrased it. That said, murder rates within cities tend to be higher than for the country at large, as this chart shows. (The red line is the rate for cities over 250,000 population, while the blue line is the rate for the country as a whole.) So this flaw in Trump's phrasing doesn't strike us as especially problematic.",
      "A bigger problem for Trump is that he leaves out some important context -- that, as we have noted previously, crime rates were heading downward for a quarter-century before the most recent uptick, and that the recent increase is nowhere near big enough to erase those gains.",
      "Sticking to murder statistics for the moment, the following chart shows a zig-zagging rise in murders between 1970 and the early 1990s, followed by a fairly steady decline since then. To be precise, the number of murders declined by 42 percent between 1993 and 2014, even as the U.S. population rose by 25 percent over the same period.",
      "The same 25-year decline also shows up in the statistics for violent crimes more generally",
      "and for property crimes, too.",
      "After the newest FBI statistics came out, we asked several criminologists how much concern they place in the recent murder spike. They said it was definitely worth noting -- but that it also needs to be understood within a broader context.",
      "\"Violent crime rates are up compared with historic lows, and they are still very, very low compared with just five or 10 years ago,\" said Raymond Paternoster, a University of Maryland criminologist.",
      "Alan Lizotte, a University at Albany criminologist, agreed. \"A small increase between two time points is not an increase when the 20 year trend is downward,\" he said. \"If it went on for several years, it might indicate an increase.\"",
      "And James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminologist said that while \"crime rose, it is far from certain that it will continue. Such a large jump in homicide, the most volatile of crime figures, can easily be followed by a turn in the other direction. One year does not make a trend.\"",
      "For a past example, look no further than an October 2006 report by the Police Executive Research Forum that cited an upward spike around 2005 that's visible in our graphs above. The group warned of \"a gathering storm of violent crime that threatens to erode the considerable crime reductions of the past.\"",
      "But starting in 2006, crime began falling again, and it stayed that way for most of the next decade.",
      "As Jeffrey Butts of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice recently told the Guardian, \"You lost 50 pounds. You gained back a couple. You're not fat. That doesn't mean you shouldn't look at your behavior, because the trend is not good.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said, \"We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.\"",
      "The number of murders nationally did rise by the biggest amount in 45 years, and criminologists agree that this is a development worth paying attention to. But they add that it comes after a steep, quarter-century decline, which suggests that it is not yet a cause for panic.",
      "The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information. We rate it Mostly True."

      "Donald Trump offered a confusing mashup of unsavory accusations during Sunday night's presidential debate as he lumped allegations against Bill Clinton with a claim about Hillary Clinton's attitude when she discussed her defense of a man accused of raping a child in 1975.",
      "Trump, asked about his offensive comments while taping a segment of Access Hollywood more than a decade ago, said, \"If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he's done to women. There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.\"",
      "Trump continued: \"Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.\"",
      "The alleged rape of a 12-year-old had nothing to do with Bill Clinton. Trump was suddenly, and without explanation, shifting gears to Hillary Clinton's successful defense of the alleged rapist after she was reluctantly assigned to the case.",
      "That's the part of Trump's claim we'll fact-check here.",
      "At the time, Clinton, 27, was working at a University of Arkansas legal aid clinic. The accused man was indigent and specifically asked for a woman to represent him.",
      "He ultimately pleaded guilty to unlawful fondling of a minor, receiving a year in jail and four years' probation.",
      "When we asked the Trump campaign about the allegations, a spokesman referred us to a July 15, 2014, article in the conservative Washington Free Beacon, which uncovered audio recordings of Clinton, although it's not clear when the recordings were made. The Beacon says they date from 1983 to 1987.",
      "In the tapes, she calls it a \"terrible case\" and \"a fascinating case,\" for reasons that will become clear.",
      "The article notes that she can be heard laughing at several points on the tape, but it doesn't say she was laughing at the victim, as Trump claims.",
      "She is \"discussing the crime lab's accidental destruction of DNA evidence that tied (the accused man, Thomas Alfred) Taylor to the crime,\" destruction that led the prosecution to seek a plea deal on a lesser charge, according to the article. (For the record, DNA testing as we know it was years away, but labs did determine blood type in criminal cases in that era.)",
      "\"I plea bargained it down because it turned out they didn't have any evidence,\" Clinton says. In the tape, available on YouTube, Clinton says of the case, \"It's sad.\"",
      "\"But you know what was sad about it was that the prosecutor had evidence,\" Clinton says.",
      "However, she recounts that the crime lab had taken a key piece of evidence the accused man's underpants, which had blood on it neatly cut out a piece, and then threw that piece away once testing was done, eliminating the ability to do independent testing. In this case, it's the interviewer, Arkansas journalist Roy Reed, who can be heard laughing, not Clinton.",
      "On the tape, in which Reed laughs a few more times at her story, Clinton can be heard chortling when she reports that the prosecutor didn't want her to see the underwear before it was presented at trial. Defense attorneys have the right to see all the evidence first.",
      "And when the judge is considering the plea deal, Clinton recounts that the judge wanted her to leave the room while he talked to the accused man. Clinton says she told the judge, \"Judge, I can't leave the room. I'm his lawyer.\" The judge reportedly responded, \"I know, but I don't want to talk about this in front of you.\" Again, Reed can be heard laughing after saying, \"Oh God. Really?\" It's not clear if Clinton is laughing as well.",
      "At another point, Clinton says of the accused man, \"I had him take a polygraph, which he passed which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs.\" She and the reporter laugh.",
      "And she laughs when she recalls telling the prosecution that she was prepared to bring in a top expert witness to testify \"to prevent this miscarriage of justice.\" The reporter laughs as well.",
      "It should be noted that it's clear from the record that Clinton aggressively defended the man and did file motions questioning the victim's credibility. But there is no evidence, including this audio tape, that Clinton or Reed were laughing at the victim.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said after Clinton helped a man accused of raping a 12-year-old, \"she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.\"",
      "Trump is referring to an audio tape in which she does respond with amusement at her recollections of the oddities of the case, which involve the prosecution and the judge.",
      "At no point does she laugh at the victim.",
      "We rate his claim False.",
      "CORRECTION, Oct. 18, 2016: This story was amended to note that the blood test referenced in the Washington Free Beacon story could not have been a true DNA match test. That technology was not available in 1975."

      "Hillary Clinton is facing criticism for her role in facilitating the creation of an industrial park in post-earthquake Haiti that has been accused of displacing farmers and failing to live up to rosy job creation projections.",
      "Among the charges, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Clinton pushed aside regulations to create sweatshop-like conditions.",
      "\"Hillary Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers' rights set up what amounts to a sweatshop in Haiti,\" Trump said Sept. 6, 2016.",
      "Clinton, as secretary of state, certainly lauded the project as part of a plan to revitalize Haiti following the devastating earthquake in 2010, and the U.S. government financially supported it. But did she help a company create a sweatshop?",
      "The evidence is thin.",
      "The Caracol Industrial Park",
      "In 2010, Haiti's leaders unveiled a plan to spur growth beyond the capital city of Port-au-Prince. One project that emerged was to build an industrial park on the country's northern coast a little over a mile from Caracol Bay. It was going to bring tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, government officials said. Getting it off the ground took a collaboration among the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the government of Haiti, and a South Korean clothing maker, Sae-A Trading.",
      "Sae-A, under the name of S&H Global, would be the anchor tenant of the new industrial park, producing clothes for clients such as Target and Walmart. Bill and Hillary Clinton, champions of that vision, came to the park's grand opening. In fact, both of them lobbied hard for the project. Bill Clinton in his role as special envoy to Haiti pushed for expanded garment making. Sae-A said Clinton herself invited the company to build a factory at the industrial park.",
      "The U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $170 million to support the industrial park by building a power plant and improving the port.",
      "\"What is happening here in Caracol is already having ripple effects that will create jobs and opportunities far beyond this industrial park,\" Hillary Clinton said at the Caracol opening ceremony.",
      "But that really hasn't happened.",
      "The industrial park has been beseiged by criticism of millions of dollars wasted, displaced farmers and sluggish job growth. Today, four years, later, total employment is about 8,100. (The State Department told us after publication that new data show the facility now employs about 9,400 people.)",
      "That's the background. Now, we'll look at the specifics of Trump's claim.",
      "Clinton's role in environmental and labor rules",
      "Trump said Clinton \"set aside environmental and labor rules\" to make the project a reality.",
      "The Trump campaign pointed to an article that appeared in the New York Times. That report cited environmentalists decrying the placement of the industrial zone near a sensitive marine habitat. The U.S. Treasury Department abstained from voting on the project due to concerns over the limited environmental impact studies that had been prepared.",
      "That's not the same as Clinton setting aside rules, and people involved with the project said Clinton played no role.",
      "Charles Krakoff, managing partner of the consulting firm Koios Associates, created the environmental impact report in an assessment for the government of Haiti and the Inter-American Development Bank. Krakoff told us that the Haitians, the development bank and USAID pressed for a quick turnaround, and he agrees that his firm did not produce a full long-term analysis. But he said he did address the immediate impacts and laid out the sort of studies needed later.",
      "The Inter-American Development Bank followed through. It commissioned a more comprehensive study in 2014, which was completed in August 2016.",
      "\"Environmental standards were not changed for this project,\" Krakoff said.",
      "USAID produced a separate environmental impact study for the power plant alone.",
      "Importantly, Krakoff said the key decision to place the industrial park in Caracol was made by the government of Haiti not Clinton. Whatever environmental issues that raised flowed from that point forward and Clinton played no role.",
      "\"We told them two other locations would be better, but the government wanted it in Caracol,\" Krakoff said. \"The Haitians and the Inter-American Development Bank had more say in this project than the United States.\"",
      "Sae-A's record on workers' rights",
      "Clinton, as we already said, did play a part in getting Sae-A to Haiti, and Sae-A does not have a perfect record with workers.",
      "The company had a significant dispute with the union at a factory in Guatemala. The AFL-CIO accused it of anti-union repression including \"acts of violence and intimidation.\" Sae-A ultimately abandonned that Guatemalan factory. But, in 2008, the International Trade Union Confederation highlighted the company as one of only three in Guatemala that had unions at all and met with union representatives weekly to discuss working conditions.",
      "We found an academic article that accurately described an episode when Sae-A managers at one plant in Guatemala used police to intimidate union organizers. The researcher cited a WikiLeaks cable from 2005 as proof, but failed to note that the cable went on to say that when the government and the company found out what happened, it fired all the managers involved and reinstated the workers with back pay.",
      "In Nicaragua, a 2013 investigation of a clash between union supporters and non-union workers found that Sae-A did nothing to prevent the unrest.",
      "So, the evidence that Sae-A violated workers rights is limited. The company had a dispute with its unions in Guatemala and allowed a fight to break out between union and non-union workers in Nicaragua.",
      "Is Sae-A running a sweatshop?",
      "Many factories in Haiti are subject to six-month inspections by Better Work Haiti, a project of the International Labor Organization. The latest assessment raises a few points of concern, but nothing that would in any way meet the definition of sweatshop conditions.",
      "On the contrary, the report lists several strengths, including providing \"free, first-class education to the workers' kids.\" The company provides paid sick and maternity leave, which according to the company, has been used in 6,336 and 220 cases respectively in 2016. There are three unions in the factory representing about 30 percent of all workers.",
      "Safety and health conditions passed muster in the assessment. The issues raised were isolated, or due more to workers not using safety equipment (ear plugs) that the company gave them (and trained them on why they should use them.)",
      "Inspectors and the company have a dispute on the legal definition for holiday, sick and maternity leave pay that has been referred to the government for resolution.Of workers who are paid based on how much they produce, only 41 percent make the government's target minimum wage, which suggests much improvement is needed, although the inspectors did not say this made the company non-compliant with the law.",
      "Pay is a point of broader concern. The advocacy group Worker Rights Consortium issued a report in 2013 that accused Sae-A of \"ongoing theft of legally-earned wages.\" But when we asked the executive director if this met the criteria of operating a sweatshop, he declined to comment. The AFL-CIO also failed to respond to questions about Sae-A.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said Clinton \"set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers' rights set up what amounts to a sweatshop in Haiti.\"",
      "There is no evidence that Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules and Trump exaggerated about the record of the South Korean company in question.",
      "We rate this statement Mostly False.",

      "Donald Trump repeated his claim that Hillary Clinton supports open borders, pointing to an excerpt of a leaked speech as new evidence.",
      "Wikileaks released more than 2,600 hacked emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, including an email with brief sections of Clinton's paid remarks to Wall Street banks. (The Clinton campaign hasn't confirmed or disputed the authenticity of the emails.) According to Trump, these speeches show \"she wants the United States to surrender to global governance with no controls over trade or immigration.\"",
      "\"Hillary Clinton's radical call for open borders, meaning anyone in the world can enter the United States without any limit at all, would end the United States as we know it today,\" he said at an Oct. 10 rally in Pennsylvania.",
      "\"By the way, weeks ago, I called out Hillary Clinton for supporting open borders and the media said I was wrong. Now, I've been proven right,\" he continued. \"Where is the media rushing to correct these false stories? Because in the Wikileaks, it was all about open borders, free trade for everybody.\"",
      "Is Trump right that Clinton really does want open borders?",
      "The leaked excerpt does contain the words \"open borders,\" but that alone doesn't make Trump's claim correct. Experts suggested Clinton could have been talking about free travel or open trade, or immigration policy. It's just not clear. What's more, Clinton's official immigration position does not contain a proposal for an open border.",
      "Clinton's immigration plan",
      "As evidence for Trump's claim, the Trump campaign referred us to Clinton's pledge to offer immigration legislation within her first 100 days in office as well as her support for sanctuary cities. We've looked into this before, and concluded that equating Clinton's immigration plan with \"open borders\" is not accurate.",
      "Clinton supported 2013 legislation (which never passed) that included a path to citizenship with conditions and billions for border enforcement for new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as adding 20,000 border agents.",
      "As a candidate, she has said she would focus on deportations for violent criminals or those who pose threats.",
      "Clinton, however, does want to make it easier for many undocumented immigrants to obtain a legal status. That's not the same as getting rid of enforcement, of course, and it's a far cry from Trump's characterization: \"Anyone in the world can enter the United States without any limit at all.\"",
      "Clinton's paid speech comment on open borders",
      "According to Trump, the Wikileaks hack vindicates his earlier charge. The speech excerpt is more ambiguous than he's suggesting, but she does use the words \"open borders.\"",
      "On Jan. 25, Clinton campaign research director Tony Carrk sent an email to Podesta that contained excerpts of Clinton's paid speeches to Wall Street banks. (For months Clinton has faced calls to release the speech transcripts but hasn't done so.)",
      "She mentioned open borders in her remarks on May 16, 2013, to the Brazilian bank Banco Itau. The excerpt, in its entirety, reads:",
      "\"My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.\"",
      "It's difficult to discern exactly what she was referring to here, because we don't have more context. The Clinton campaign didn't respond to our request for the full speech.",
      "But a campaign spokesman pointed to statements by Podesta and Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook on Oct. 9. Both said the context of that sentence related to green energy -- and wasn't about people immigrating to the United States.",
      "On Face the Nation, Mook said she was talking about integrating green energy between north and south America.",
      "\"But if the question is does Hillary Clinton support throwing open our borders, absolutely not. And she is going to do everything she can to fight to protect the interest of workers in this country. That is actually why she voted against the Central American free trade agreement when she was a senator,\" Mook said.",
      "On Fox News Sunday, Podesta also said she was referring to clean energy.",
      "\"When she was secretary of state, she talked about creating a hemispheric effort to bring clean energy across the continent from the tip of South America to Canada, to invest in clean and renewable energy, to invest in the transmission that would clean up our energy system,\" Podesta said. \"And I think when you look at what she said about immigration, she's for comprehensive immigration reform that takes people out of the shadows, emphasizes family unity, but also has -- modernizes our border security.",
      "Are her remarks a call for open borders for immigrants?",
      "We interviewed three immigration experts and asked them if they thought she was calling for open borders for immigrants and whether it was in conflict with her campaign immigration plan.",
      "The experts said Clinton's remarks were not a clear-cut call for open borders. They also said that her statement sounded aspirational and contained no timeline or explanation as to how she would make it happen politically.",
      "\"I would note her emphasis on a hemispheric' common market, an idea that became more concrete in 1994 when her husband, Bill Clinton, hosted the first Summit of the Americas meeting in Miami,\" said Stephen Kelly, a Duke University public policy professor.",
      "That summit involved 34 democracies, and \"open markets, hemispheric integration, and free trade\" were all cited as a means of increasing prosperity at the meeting, Kelly said. Those summits have continued, and Clinton attended one in 2012 as secretary of state.",
      "\"My guess would be that Clinton's Brazil speech reflects this broader call for greater hemispheric cooperation on a variety of issues, including trade,\" Kelly said. \"Given this context, and without seeing the rest of her speech, I would also guess that the open borders' she mentions relate to the movement of goods and capital, but not people.\"",
      "Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a policy institute focused on foreign policy and national security, said that Clinton seemed to refer to something related to travel such as the Schengen Agreement, which abolished many of the European Union's internal borders.",
      "For example, if the United States and Canada had such an agreement, that would not mean an open border for free immigration, but rather for free travel.",
      "\"I don't think she is calling for open immigration, but the context of her remarks shows that when she says open borders,' she doesn't just mean open trade,\" he said.",
      "Jacob Vigdor, professor of public policy and governance University of Washington, said Clinton appeared to be talking about both trade and immigration.",
      "\"I would read the remark as calling for open borders with regard to both trade and immigration. Otherwise the term open trade and open borders' would be redundant,\" he said.",
      "However, he said he saw no timetable in her remarks beyond \"some time in the future,\" or discussion about how to make it happen.",
      "\"I don't necessarily see a contradiction between a statement of ideals and a more pragmatic policy agenda for reality,\" he said. \"One can dream of a crime-free world where there is need for neither police nor prisons while still supporting those things in reality.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said, \"I've been proven right\" about \"Hillary Clinton's radical call for open borders, meaning anyone in the world can enter the United States without any limit at all.\"",
      "Trump is referring to a leaked speech excerpt in which Clinton purportedly says, \"My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.\"",
      "We don't have more context about what Clinton meant by \"open borders\" because she has not released the full speech. Her campaign has said she was talking about clean energy across the hemisphere.",
      "Trump argues that it directly applies to her current immigration policy. She has not called for open borders in this campaign. Clinton has proposed making it easier for the current undocumented population to gain a path to citizenship with conditions, but she has also supported beefed-up border security.",
      "The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",

      "The death of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens came up as a topic during the second presidential debate Sunday night.",
      "When moderator Anderson Cooper asked Donald Trump if tweeting about a sex tape between 3 and 5 a.m. reflected the discipline of a good leader, Trump denied using those words and suddenly veered onto the subject of the 2012 attack on the mission compound in Benghazi, Libya. Security was inadequate and Stevens died of smoke inhalation from a fire during an attack by insurgents.",
      "Trump, apparently thinking that the drama unfolded at 3 a.m. in Washington, started referring to a famous Hillary Clinton commercial from her 2008 run for president, which argued that she was the best person for responding to a national emergency, as represented by a hypothetical 3 a.m. phone call to the White House.",
      "Trump: \"She said, 'Who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?' Guess what? She didn't answer because ... Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.\"",
      "It's hard to overstate how much is wrong here.",
      "The attack on the compound actually began at 9:42 p.m. in Libya, which was 3:42 p.m. in Washington. By 3 a.m. in Washington the following day, the attacks were over, and the people involved had either left Benghazi or were less than an hour from being flown out.",
      "So for this fact-check, we're going to focus on whether Stevens made 600 requests for help.",
      "Trump's cryptic comment might be heard as suggesting that Stevens made 600 \"requests for help\" during the attack. The investigations of Benghazi show that didn't happen. In fact, when we contacted the Trump campaign, they referred us to a graph that claimed something very different.",
      "First, there's no debate that security at the mission was inadequate and that requests for improvements stalled or rejected.",
      "Some security improvements were made the year of the attack, including \"heightening the perimeter wall, installing concrete Jersey barriers, mounting safety grills on the safe area windows, and other minor improvements,\" according to a 2014 Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report. But while the CIA was making significant upgrades to its nearby annex, similar improvements were not being done at the Benghazi mission. The CIA annex had nine security officers, but only three officers were assigned to the mission complex.",
      "A month before the attack, with the security situation deteriorating, Army Gen. Carter Ham, who was head of U.S. Africa Command, twice offered to give the U.S. embassy in Tripoli a special military security team. Stevens declined the offer. No reason was given, but it may have had to do with the State Department not wanting to aggravate the political instability in Libya with the presence of U.S. forces.",
      "When we contacted the Trump campaign, spokesman Dan Kowalski cited this chart, which was displayed during hearings by the Republican-led House Select Committee on Benghazi.",
      "",
      "But there's no reference to this chart in the report itself, released months later.",
      "Democrats on the committee, in their minority report, said that, \"During our hearing with Secretary Clinton, Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan) argued that the Select Committee had obtained over 600 requests' for security from Benghazi, but he refused to provide the evidence for his claim.\"",
      "The minority report continues, \"Democrats have been unable to successfully reconstruct a list of 600 requests for additional security, and have been able to identify fewer than 200 requests, many of which were granted.\"",
      "A few things are worth noting right off the bat.",
      "The Republicans' count is 569, not 600, accumulated over nine months.",
      "Stevens wasn't sworn in as ambassador to Libya until May 2012. So even if every one of those requests/concerns originated from Stevens and went directly to Clinton, the highest number Trump could cite would be 205, not 600.",
      "The count is supposed to be the number of security requests or concerns from Benghazi to the State Department, not from Stevens to Clinton, as Trump said. This can get ambiguous because such correspondence is often sent under the name of the ambassador, even if he/she never saw it, to the secretary of state, even though in the vast majority of cases it's handled by lower-level people and the secretary never sees it.",
      "As Clinton noted during her Jan. 23, 2013, testimony on the Benghazi attack, \"1.43 million cables a year come to the State Department. They are all addressed to me. They do not all come to me. They are reported through the bureaucracy.\"",
      "It's also not clear if all these requests were actually for Benghazi or were security-related requests involving the U.S. embassy in Tripoli as well.",
      "Earlier this year, the Washington Post Fact Checker looked into the 600 number, which was being cited by Trump and others. He found duplication.",
      "Once a request is made it can be followed by one or more statements of \"concern\" on the same topic, so there's a lot of overlap in the count.",
      "The Post was given only a cursory look at the data used by the GOP staff to come up with their total, but he noted that one subject heading was repeated 17 times, suggesting that the same request was being repeatedly discussed. That alone may have inflated the total.",
      "To properly check whether the same security-related requests were being reported under different subject headings, the committee would have to release the documents.",
      "At the time, Kessler was reporting that the committee's final report \"is supposed to list the documents that formed the basis of the 600 figure.\"",
      "We contacted the committee twice and received no response. If we get additional information, we'll update this fact-check.",

      "There certainly were many requests for security improvements at the mission. But Trump goes way over the line, citing a graph that includes a period when Stevens wasn't even the ambassador and doesn't differentiate between actual requests for improved security and follow-up correspondence.",
      "The highest the number could be, according to that data, is 205 and there's no evidence that those \"requests and concerns\" which may include duplicates were even sent by Stevens.",

      "Donald Trump tripled down on his baseless claim that the U.S. election system is rigged against him, capping a weekend of lashing out at the media for publishing \"fabricated\" allegations of sexual assault and at Alec Baldwin for impersonating Trump on Saturday Night Live.",
      "House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans defended the Election Day process at an Oct. 15 rally, but Trump continued to blame the media for \"pushing Crooked Hillary\" and added that rigging is happening at \"many polling places.\"",
      "\"Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!\" Trump tweeted the morning of Oct. 17.",
      "Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!",
      "The Trump campaign reiterated Trump's stance that the cards are stacked against Trump, pointing to a column from The Hill's media reporter Joe Concha on how the media could influence voter perceptions of Trump. To be clear, this is not the same thing as a voter committing fraud.",
      "The Trump campaign also pointed us to a 2012 Pew Center study that estimated about 24 million, equal to one in every eight, voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are inaccurate. But as we have previously reported, no evidence of voter fraud was found this is about record-keeping that is badly managed and in disarray.",
      "The other piece of evidence offered by the Trump campaign is a 2014 study that says approximately 6.4 percent of noncitizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 percent in 2010. That study has been criticized by election experts for using an unreliable database of Internet respondents.",
      "And finally, the Trump campaign forwarded us reports of voting irregularities in swing states like Pennsylvania, Colorado and Virginia. But these reports were either of reported and prevented cases of fraud or isolated instances. They do not amount to rampant, widespread fraud or assert that the few cases affected the outcome of an election.",
      "Voter fraud is rare. Trump talking about it is not.",
      "Voter fraud isn't a catch-all term for any election shenanigan. Voter fraud is rare and refers to illegal interference in voting, such as ballot stuffing, voter impersonation or vote buying.",
      "Before his White House bid, Trump tweeted about dead voters delivering President Barack Obama's victory in 2012, floated charges about multiple voting in the primaries, and suggested that undocumented immigrants \"just walk in and vote\" in some polling places.",
      "These charges do not reflect reality.",
      "News 21, a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found 150 alleged cases of double voting, 56 cases of noncitizens voting, and 10 cases of voter impersonation across all elections from 2000 to 2011. Many of these allegations never led to charges, while others were acquitted or dismissed.",
      "Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School and an expert on voter fraud, found an even smaller number: 31 credible incidents out of more than 1 billion votes cast from 2000 to 2014.",
      "Put it in another way: More people are struck by lightning or attacked by sharks than are accused of voter fraud.",
      "When voter fraud does occur, it's not always intentional. Multiple studies have traced known cases not to willful deception but to clerical errors or confusion.",
      "For example, one case of a dead person voting (Alan J. Mandell) happened because a poll worker accidentally marked his name instead of the man who actually cast the ballot, Alan J. Mandel. Similarly, in one of just five cases of a noncitizen voting between 2000 and 2004, a permanent resident was told he was eligible and given a voter registration form by a DMV clerk when renewing his license.",
      "So, given the rarity of occurrence, the lack of intent, and a federal penalty of a $10,000 fine or up to five years in prison, experts say it would be extremely difficult to rig an election through the ways Trump has decried.",
      "\"I'd like to see him try to vote 10 times on Election Day. It would be virtually impossible and a knuckle-headed way to try to corrupt an election,\" Lorraine Minnite, a political science professor at Rutgers University who wrote The Myth of Voter Fraud, previously told PolitiFact.",
      "For double or triple voting to sway an election, an army of voters would have to visit multiple polling locations each, know the names and addresses of the people they were impersonating and produce fake IDs (in many states) or forge their signatures plus commit to committing perjury the entire time.",
      "\"Campaigns don't pay people to pretend to be people they're not. That's too stupid,\" said Mary Frances Berry, former chairwoman of the U.S Commission on Civil Rights and author of Five Dollars and a Pork Chop Sandwich, a book about electoral fraud.",
      "So there is no evidence of a massive attempt to rig the election on and before Election Day.",
      "Collusion confusion",
      "Trump elaborated on his voter fraud theory a few hours after his initial tweet.",
      "\"Voter fraud! Crooked Hillary Clinton even got the questions to a debate, and nobody says a word. Can you imagine if I got the questions?\" he tweeted.",
      "His follow-up is not evidence of large-scale voter fraud, though it does bring up a separate concern revealed by Wikileaks.",
      "Trump is referring to an email obtained by Wikileaks from then-CNN contributor and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile with the subject line, \"From time to time, I get the the questions in advance.\"",
      "\"Here's one that worries me about HRC,\" Brazile wrote to Clinton's communications director Jennifer Palmieri on March 12, 2016. \"Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty?\"",
      "Palmieri wrote back: \"Hi. Yes, it is one she gets asked about. Not everyone likes her answer but can share it.\"",
      "The next day, CNN co-moderated a Democratic primary town hall, and one person asked Clinton about the death penalty.",
      "But Brazile, who is now interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman, has denied that she notified the Clinton camp of the question and says she never had access to the questions in the first place. (The Clinton campaign has yet to confirm or deny the authenticity of the emails.)",
      "A CNN spokesperson told Politico, \"we have never, ever given a town hall question to anyone beforehand.\" CNN host Jake Tapper, one of the debate moderators, called the leak \"very, very upsetting,\" and the network has blamed debate partner TV One as the source.",

      "\"We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election,\" Clinton said. \"I find that deeply disturbing.\"",
      "Back in July, when WikiLeaks released the DNC emails, the government hadn't yet named a culprit.",
      "On Oct. 7, however the same day WikiLeaks released the emails of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta the Homeland Security Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a joint statement that said, \"The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations.\"",
      "The statement added that the recent hacks \"are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process.\"",

      "The 17 separate agencies did not independently declare Russia the perpetrator behind the hacks. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said that this cuts against Clinton's point, saying, \"It is unlikely that all 16 of the agencies had looked independently at the Russian connection, which is what Clinton seemed to indicate.\" (Cheung said 16 agencies because he omitted the Office of the Director of National Intelligence from his count.)",

The process of putting that report together didn't start until months after we published this article, in December 2016, at which point the intelligence community decided to restrict the investigation to those three agencies.",

      "\"Additionally, I'll briefly address four related topics that have emerged since the ICA was produced. Because of both classification and some executive privilege strictures requested by the White House, there are limits to what I can discuss.

      "The October statement, on the other hand, said \"The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident\" in its assessment. As we noted in the article, the 17 separate agencies did not independently come to this conclusion, but as the head of the intelligence community, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence speaks on behalf of the group.",

How do you miss $6 billion? You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen they don't know. It's gone, $6 billion. If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess. Believe me.\"",

      "In fact, the claim that the State Department lost $6 billion, or that it was stolen, has been debunked. Including by us.",
      "Trump's inaccurate claim stems from a misreading of a March 2014 alert out of the State Department's Office of the Inspector General. The alert found that paperwork for various contracts was mismanaged. These contracts were together worth about $6 billion. The money didn't go missing; the paperwork did.",
      "The State Department Inspector General sent out an alert that summarized previous audits, which found that paperwork for over $6 billion worth of contracts from 2008 to 2014 \"were incomplete or could not be located at all.\" The period of the audits included time before Clinton became secretary of state.",
      "A spokesman for the Office of the Inspector General told PolitiFact previously the alert speaks for itself, but many seemed to misinterpret what it actually said. The confusion prompted Inspector General Steve Linick to pen a clarification in the Washington Post.",
      "\"Some have concluded based on this that $6 billion is missing. The alert, however, did not draw that conclusion,\" he wrote. \"Instead, it found that the failure to adequately maintain contract files documents necessary to ensure the full accounting of U.S. tax dollars creates significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the department's contract actions.' \"",
      "In other words, the State Department was terrible at paperwork. The $6 billion figure refers to the total amount affected by file mismanagement. It's akin to failing to get a receipt for your $20 lunch. Documentation over where that $20 went is gone, but not the $20 itself.",
      "For example, the inspector general alert notes that an audit of the Bureau of African Affairs found that the office was unable to provide full administrative files for eight separate contracts, valued at a combined $34.8 million.",
      "So the State Department under Clinton may have been financially disorganized and, according to the alert, opening itself up to fraud. But it didn't \"lose\" $6 billion. Nor was there any suggestion it was \"stolen.\"",

      "In a combative cable news interview that has gone viral, Fox News host Megyn Kelly and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich -- a prominent Donald Trump surrogate -- clashed over allegations that Trump had groped nearly a dozen women over the years.",
      "Among other things, Gingrich countered that the husband of Trump's opponent, former president Bill Clinton, has gotten off light after being involved in sex scandals during the 1980s and 1990s. Here's an excerpt of the Oct. 25 interview:",
      "Gingrich: \"No, I just want to hear you use the words. I want to hear you use the words, Bill Clinton, sexual predator.' I dare you. Say, Bill Clinton, sexual predator.' \"",
      "Kelly: \"Mr. Speaker, we've covered excuse me, sir \"",
      "Gingrich: \"Disbarred by the Arkansas bar.\"",
      "Kelly: \"Excuse me. excuse me.\"",
      "Gingrich: \"Disbarred by the Arkansas bar; $850,000 penalty.\"",
      "We wondered about Gingrich's assertion that Bill Clinton had paid an \"$850,000 penalty.\" That was a figure Clinton paid in a settlement over alleged sexual impropriety with Paula Jones, an Arkansas state worker when Clinton was Arkansas governor. Jones sued him over the alleged incident in a case that ultimately led to Clinton's impeachment battle.",
      "We found that not only is Gingrich wrong to call that sum a \"penalty,\" but also that Gingrich is uniquely unsuited to argue that it was in fact a penalty. Let's explore the details.",
      "Is Clinton's $850,000 payment a penalty'?",
      "Clinton did indeed pay Jones $850,000. But the payment in question does not fit the commonly accepted legal definition of a \"penalty,\" legal experts said.",
      "Here's how the Washington Post described the payment in its contemporary coverage in 1998:",
      "President Clinton reached an out-of-court settlement with Paula Jones yesterday, agreeing to pay her $850,000 to drop the sexual harassment lawsuit that led to the worst political crisis of his career and only the third presidential impeachment inquiry in American history.",
      "After more than 4 1/2 years of scorched-earth legal warfare, Clinton and Jones brought a sudden end to the case with a four-page deal in which he acknowledged no wrongdoing and offered no apology. ...",
      "Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's chief attorney in the case, said the president still insists Jones's allegations of a crude proposition in a Little Rock hotel suite seven years ago \"are baseless\" but agreed to make the payment in the interest of finally putting the matter behind him. The case was dismissed without a trial.",
      "So we know a few important things about the $850,000 payment. It came after the trial court had dismissed the case. It was made as part of an out-of-court settlement between Clinton and Jones. And as part of the agreement, Clinton made no acknowledgment of guilt.",
      "All of these things undercut the notion that the payment was a penalty, legal experts said.",
      "\"A penalty is generally imposed by a governmental entity for a violation of a law, rule or regulation,\" said Brett Kappel, a lawyer who specializes in political ethics law with the firm Akerman. \"Payments to resolve civil suits are treated as compensation for a harmful or wrongful act. They are not a penalty.' \"",
      "Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed that \"it's not accurate to call a settlement a penalty.' \"",
      "Roosevelt said that penalties \"are usually imposed without a party's consent and on the basis of wrongdoing. ... individuals have no power to impose penalties on other individuals.\"",
      "Why Gingrich's use of the term penalty' here is ironic",
      "As it happens, Gingrich has some experience with parsing the definition of legal penalties -- and not in a way that supports his case against Clinton.",
      "In 2012, a Mitt Romney-affiliated Super PAC said that Gingrich, then a Republican primary rival of Romney, had been \"fined $300,000 for ethics violations\" dating back to Gingrich's tenure in Congress in the 1990s. In January 1997, the House voted to approve a committee's report demanding that Gingrich pay a sum of $300,000 and admit that he had \"engaged in conduct that did not reflect creditably on the House of Representatives.\" (Here's a timeline of the case.)",
      "We initially rated the super PAC's claim True. However, after publication, one of Gingrich's ethics lawyers in the case, J. Randolph Evans, demanded that we change our rating. He argued that Gingrich wasn't \"fined\" by the ethics committee but rather had to pay a \"cost assessment.\" Given this linguistic technicality, we ended up downgrading our rating, but only from True to Mostly True, since legal experts told us that a \"cost assessment\" was not substantially different than a \"fine.\"",
      "\"Gingrich's earlier position does undercut his current one,\" Roosevelt said.",
      "We reached out to the Trump campaign, Evans, and Clinton lawyer Robert Bennett but did not receive replies.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Gingrich said that in the Paula Jones case, Bill Clinton paid an \"$850,000 penalty.\" According to legal experts, Clinton's $850,000 payment does not qualify as a \"penalty.\" It wasn't imposed by a court (the court had dismissed the case); it was negotiated by the parties out of court; and it came with no admission of guilt. Given his past experience with careful parsing of how legal penalties are defined, Gingrich of all people should have known this. We rate his statement Half True."

      "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump switched over the weekend from lambasting Hillary Clinton's email policies to criticizing how President Barack Obama has handled the economy.",
      "\"Obama is the first president in modern history not to have a single year of 3 percent growth,\" Trump said during an Oct. 28 campaign rally in Manchester, N.H.",
      "We decided to look back at the economic data and found that Trump was right, as long as you're looking at the economic statistics a specific way.",
      "ABCs of GDP",
      "The Trump campaign didn't respond to our requests for more specifics, but we can make a couple of assumptions.",
      "When Trump talked of growth, he likely meant the percent change in gross domestic product, called GDP, which is the total value of goods and services in the country. The time frame he's using is indistinct, but \"a single year\" probably relates to the annual change in GDP.",
      "Looking at the economic statistics under those guidelines, Trump would be correct. But the comparison he's making about Obama provides a narrow view of the economy.",
      "\"I suppose he's using year-over-year data, with which the claim is true but misleading,\" Princeton economist Alan Blinder told PolitiFact Florida. Blinder and another Princeton economics professor, David Watson, examined GDP growth during presidential administrations in a July 2014 study.",
      "There are any number of historical vagaries that color what affects GDP during any administration, Obama included. Obama has overseen the country climbing out of a historical recession that left the housing market depressed, wages low, and businesses wary of investing. He's also had a Congress that has largely pushed an austerity agenda against his wishes. And global crises like instability in the Middle East and slowed growth in China and Europe have lowered demand for U.S. products and pushed the dollar higher.",
      "\"The fact that the economy has steadily improved is actually fairly remarkable, considering what else has been happening,\" said Christian Weller, a University of Massachusetts Boston public policy professor and a fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress.",
      "Annual figures on GDP growth goes back to 1929, and often is used to back up the same talking point on conservative media outlets that Obama has not had a full calendar year of aggregate GDP growth of at least 3 percent.",
      "U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data shows Herbert Hoover, who was inaugurated in March 1929 and left office in March 1933, was the last president to have this distinction. Hoover presided over an economy mired in the Great Depression that shrank during his term.",
      "Every president since then has seen at least one calendar year with annual GDP growth of at least 3 percent or higher. The best average growth in a single calendar year under Obama is 2.6 percent in 2015, and never 3 percent or more. No president has experienced that since Hoover.",
      "But experts said Trump's use of \"modern history\" is vague, and using the annual change in GDP is perhaps not the best measure. The best data goes back to 1947, when the federal government started tracking GDP by quarter.",
      "That would give a more nuanced picture of the data the economy in the first quarter of a presidency is often attributed to the preceding administration, for example. It also would coincide with the historical boom in the nation's economy after World War II.",
      "Going by quarters, growth within a year was higher than 3 percent during two periods during Obama's presidency, Blinder said. Between the third quarters of 2009 and 2010, GDP growth was 3.4 percent. From the first quarters of 2014 and of 2015, it was 3.3 percent.",
      "Overall growth rates for several administrations have exceeded 3 percent, but Weller said context is important.",
      "Without complete data for 2016, the average growth rate during Obama's two terms was 2 percent, Weller said. That was on par with George H.W. Bush's term and faster than George W. Bush's average.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said, \"Obama is the first president in modern history not to have a single year of 3 percent growth.\"",
      "Although Trump's light on specifics, that's accurate if he is looking solely at year-over-year figures for GDP growth going back to the Hoover administration. Experts told us that presenting the stats the way Trump did doesn't tell the whole story. And if we examine the data annually by quarters, Obama has presided over periods of growth topping 3 percent.",

      "That nuance was lost on many people. More than 125,000 signed a petition posted Oct. 21, 2016, on the White House website that said, \"We the people ask Congress to meet in emergency session about removing George Soros-owned voting machines from 16 states.\"",
      "To be clear, abundant evidence shows that Soros owns no voting machines in the United States.",
      "To go further, the link between Soros and Smartmatic is gossamer thin.",
      "Company CEO Antonio Mugica and chairman Lord Mark Malloch-Brown said in a statement, \"George Soros has zero ownership or involvement in our company. Smartmatic has no ties to political parties or groups in any country and it abides by a strict code of ethics that forbids the company from donating to any political campaigns of any kind.\"",
      "The one connection between Soros and Malloch-Brown is that Malloch-Brown sits on the global board of Soros' Open Society Foundations. Malloch-Brown is a former minister of State in the British cabinet and, as the Smartmatic website stated, he is a member of \"a number of non-profit boards addressing global issues from poverty reduction to conflict resolution.\"",
      "On top of all this, no state is using Smartmatic machines in this election.",
      "The Verified Voting Foundation, a group founded by a Stanford computer scientist to promote accuracy in voting, tracks all companies that provide voting equipment in the United States. Smartmatic has no such equipment in any state. (Hat-tip to Snopes, the internet rumor-zapping website that first dug into this.) The Utah Republican Party used a Smartmatic system in the 2016 primary, and Los Angeles County tested one element for provisional and mail-in ballots.",
      "All of this information was available before Duffy's interview. (In addition to Snopes and the Washington Post, investigative journalism website ProPublica also debunked the idea.)",
      "Duffy's communications director Mark Bednar said, \"Congressman Duffy didn't claim anything in particular and merely spoke about what people have been recently discussing throughout the nation.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Duffy said that there were unverified reports that a George Soros company was providing voting machines in certain states. In the week before Duffy said that, those reports had been fully discredited three times. Soros owns no company that offers voting machines, and the company named in the rumor has no voting machines in the United States.",

      "It's an old political motto: A good offense is good defense. So to defend Donald Trump's policies on immigration, vice presidential nominee Mike Pence went on the attack against Hillary Clinton's policies.",
      "On NBC's Meet the Press, moderator Chuck Todd asked Pence about Trump's policies to ban Muslims from entering the United States. In recent weeks, Trump has said he would ban Muslims from countries with terrorist activity.",
      "When Todd pressed Pence about what countries those would be, Pence changed the subject to Clinton's Syria policy.",
      "\"Well, Hillary Clinton wants to increase Syrian refugees to this country by 550 percent,\" Pence said. \"Donald Trump and I believe that we should suspend the Syrian refugee program.\"",
      "Pence added that their preferred policy is to work with Arab countries to establish safe zones closer to Syria.",
      "We wanted to look at Pence's claim that Clinton's policy is for 550 percent increase. That number is accurate for now.",
      "Syrian refugees by the numbers",
      "The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is the international agency that tracks and promotes refugee resettlement around the world. Its current count of people who have fled the civil war in Syria, which started in 2011, is 4.8 million.",
      "Many of those 4.8 million refugees are in neighboring countries such as Turkey, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. Due to overcrowding and the large number of overall refugees, the UN has called on other countries around the world to accept more Syrians for resettlement.",
      "President Barack Obama agreed on behalf of the United States to accept 10,000 refugees for fiscal year 2016. The number was reached on Aug. 29, 2016, and the UN hailed the milestone in a press release.",
      "\"We thank the communities in the United States that have kept their doors open and also our civil society partners for their tireless humanitarian efforts. Much more needs to be done for Syrian refugees and for the global crisis that has seen more people flee persecution than at any time ever recorded,\" said Shelly Pitterman, UNHCR regional representative in the United States.",
      "The agency reported that around 478,000 Syrians are in need of resettlement, and Syrians make up about 40 percent of all refugees worldwide who need resettlement.",
      "In September 2015, Clinton had called the 10,000-figure for the United States a good start but had urged an increase up to 65,000. Clinton said then the United States should be \"looking to really emphasize some of those who are most vulnerable, a lot of the persecuted religious minorities, including Christians, and some who have been brutalized, like the Yazidi women.\"",
      "That 65,000-figure is a 550 percent increase from the 10,000 that Obama supported.",
      "It's important to note, however, that those numbers applied to fiscal year 2016, which ends by Oct. 1, 2016. Clinton has not discussed numbers for the next fiscal year. So it's possible that 550 percent number may soon be out of date.",
      "We should also note that there is a screening process for refugees. The UN identifies and screens refugees before they are referred to a country for resettlement. U.S. security agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, then conduct multiple security checks.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Pence pointed to a real policy distinction between the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees when he said that Clinton \"wants to increase Syrian refugees to this country by 550 percent.\" Trump is opposed to refugee settlement, while Clinton supports it, and at a greater number than Obama's current policy. Clinton supported allowing in 65,000 refugees when Obama supported a 10,000 figure. (The refugees would be screened.) That's a 550 percent increase. The UN has determined that about 478,000 Syrian refugees are in need of resettlement.",

      "The long shadow of the Iraq War continues to color presidential politics.",

      "When it was Trump's turn, the Republican nominee denied the charge.",
      "\"I was totally against the war in Iraq,\" Trump said during the NBC News event. \"You can look at Esquire magazine from '04. You can look at before that.\"",
      "Well, we have gone back further than the 2004 interview Trump mentioned, and the record tells a different story.",
      "Trump has a hard time getting past a September 2002 interview with shock jock Howard Stern. Stern asked Trump if he supported the looming invasion.",
      "Trump responded, \"Yeah, I guess so.\"",
      "Trump dialed that back a bit in another interview in January 2003, a few months before the invasion. Fox News' Neil Cavuto asked Trump whether President George W. Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy.",
      "\"Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know,\" Trump said. \"He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.\"",
      "So Trump put the economy ahead of confronting Iraq, but he didn't speak against going to war. At most he suggested waiting for the United Nations to do something.",
      "A week after the United States invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003, Trump gave different takes. At an Academy Awards after-party, Trump said that \"the war's a mess,\" according to the Washington Post. He told Fox News that because of the war, \"The market's going to go up like a rocket.\"",
      "The earliest evidence of Trump's outright opposition to the war came in that August 2004 article in Esquire:",
      "\"Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump has been challenged many times in this election to explain his early acceptance of the war. In a February 2016 interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Trump said that he didn't know what he meant during his 2002 conversation with Stern.",

      "During an NBC forum that focused on the presidential candidates' national security chops, host Matt Lauer asked Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton why it isn't disqualifying that she dealt with highly sensitive material on a private, unclassified email system.",
      "Clinton said she made a mistake using the system, but she still took classification seriously.",
      "\"I have a lot of experience dealing with classified material, starting when I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee going into the four years as secretary of state,\" she said. \"Classified material has a header which says top secret, secret, confidential.' Nothing, and I will repeat this, and this is verified in the report by the Department of Justice, none of the emails sent or received by me had such a header.\"",
      "Given that we've found Clinton's email did contain some classified information, this statement intrigued us.",
      "Information isn't classified until a designated authority within the government declares it classified. The way that person shows their determination is by adding a header and footer to the relevant document, often tacking on a cover sheet, too all to make it clear that the document contains classified information.",
      "Clinton is correct that the FBI did not find any such labels in her emails.",
      "Of the tens of thousands of emails the FBI reviewed, 81 email chains found on Clinton's private servers included classified information, as determined by various U.S. intelligence agencies, according to a FBI report released Sept. 2. Just three email chains included some sort of classification marking: At least one paragraph preceded by the marking \"(C),\" indicating that those paragraphs were \"confidential,\" the lowest level of classification. But none of the three had a header, footer or cover page further signaling that the emails contained confidential information.",
      "Even though there was a \"(C)\" preceding the paragraphs, this information was not properly marked confidential because it did not include the header, FBI Director James Comey said in a July 7 hearing before Congress. It's \"reasonable,\" he said, that Clinton may not have realized these were classified.",
      "For Clinton's part, she told the FBI that \"she did not know what the \"(C)\" meant at the beginning of the paragraphs and speculated it was referencing paragraphs marked in alphabetical order,\" according to the bureau's report. She also disputed the need for these particular paragraphs to be classified at all.",
      "So that's three email chains out of 81 found to include classified information on Clinton's private email server. What about the other 78?",
      "Clinton, in her statement, said classified material has a header that says \"classified\" and that none her emails had that header. But that leaves out the possibility of what happened in this case classified information is left unlabeled as a result of human error.",
      "All information determined to be classified should have a header in order to designate it properly. But if someone makes a mistake and forgets to include the label after that original determination, the information is still classified.",
      "\"In that case, the information was classified, but in the absence of markings, the person receiving the information may have no realistic way of knowing that fact,\" said Liza Goitein, co-director of the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "\" Classified' isn't an inherent or self-evident status. It's an act,\" she said. \"And that act is rather meaningless if not conveyed to others.\"",
      "Comey has said it's understandable that Clinton did not realize some of this unmarked information was classified. But he also has said she should have recognized by the topic of discussion that some of these emails did not belong on a non-classified system, given that 36 of these email chains had \"secret\" information and eight had \"top secret\" information.",
      "\"There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about the matters should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation,\" Comey said in a July 5 statement.",
      "For example, some of these email discussions touched on the CIA's drone program. Members of Clinton's staff told the FBI that some of this supposedly classified drone-related information had already been revealed to the public in news reports.",
      "Clinton regularly dealt with classified information as secretary of state. She has said she viewed classified information in hard copy in her office, and she used other secure channels when traveling. Some emails now made public actually show Clinton's team discussing how they couldn't email each other classified information over the private server and instead had to move the conversation to a more appropriate venue.",
      "In the end, Comey said the Justice Department shouldn't prosecute Clinton because there isn't enough evidence that she intentionally mishandled classified information, nor did investigators find vast quantities of exposed classified material.",
      "Many transparency experts say the government regularly over-classifies, such as classifying information that wouldn't actually damage national security if released. That's likely the case regarding Clinton's emails, said Thomas Blanton, director of the National Security Archive at George Washington University, which favors less classification.",
      "\"The point is there's no objective standard for classification,\" Blanton said. \"Very little of what's classified would be deemed so by all experienced observers.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Clinton said, \"Classified material has a header which says top secret, secret, confidential.' Nothing, and I will repeat this, and this is verified in the reports by the Department of Justice, none of the emails sent or received by me had such a header.\"",
      "For information to be considered properly marked classified, it must contain a header. Clinton is correct that nothing in her email had a header signifying its classification status. Three email chains had a \"(C)\" indicating \"confidential\" information, but that is not enough to consider the emails properly marked classified.",
      "But that doesn't mean there wasn't any classified information in her email. If someone has determined information to be classified, it is still technically classified even if someone neglects to label it down the line. The FBI found 81 email chains that contained information determined to be classified, though none of the information was appropriately labeled, so it wasn't necessarily obvious to the recipients.",
      "Clinton's carefully worded statement is accurate but needs additional information. For that, we rate her claim Mostly True.",

      "Below a photograph of Obama are the words, \"Has taken less vacation days than any other president in a generation.\" Below an image of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan are the words, \"Have taken more vacation days than any other Congress in history.\"",
      "The introduction to the Aug. 20 image insists, \"The numbers don't lie.\" It had been shared 45,470 times by Sept. 6, 2016.",
      "Bad grammar aside (it should be \"fewer\" vacation days, not \"less\"), we wanted to know if the data checked out. We repeatedly contacted the group but didn't hear back.",
      "Presidential vacations",
      "First, it's important to realize that if you're only going back a generation (20 years), you're only comparing Obama to two other presidents Bill Clinton who took office in 1993 and George W. Bush, who was inaugurated in 2001.",
      "We turned to Mark Knoller, White House correspondent at CBS News, the zen master of data on all things presidential such as vacations, trips, news conferences and even teleprompter use.",
      "He told us via email that Obama has been on 28 vacations (including long weekends) spanning all or part of 217 days. The president has just over four months left in his term.",
      "His predecessor, Bush, made 77 visits to his Texas ranch spanning all or part of 490 days. There were also 11 visits to his parent's home in Kennebunkport, Maine, spanning all or part of 43 days. Total: 533.",
      "But by Knoller's count, Clinton took the fewest 174 days of summer vacations on Martha's Vineyard and at Jackson Hole, Wyo.",

      "We didn't have to go very far back in time to discover that this part of the Occupy Democrats meme is wrong as well.",

After all, when members don't have to be in Washington for a vote, they may be in their districts, meeting with voters, or attending to official duties. And let's be real here they might also be treating it like a vacation.",
      "As of Sept. 6, 2016, the House had been in session 94 days. The Senate had been in session 114 days. We decided to start by looking at House calendars.",
      "This year, the House is scheduled to be in session for another 32 days. That means House members will have been officially working in Washington for a total of about 126 days.",
      "That's more days on the calendar than in 2008, when House members met for 119 calendar days, and in 2006, when they met for 104 days.",
      "The House looks even less lazy if you look at 2015, the first year of the current Congress. That year, the House met for 157 calendar days, more than in 2014 (137 days), 2012 (153 days), 2010 (128 days), 2008 (119 days) and 2006 (104 days).",
      "Alternatively, we looked at the data in two-year blocks, which would be full sessions of Congress. The current House (the 114th session, 2015-16) has met or is scheduled to meet for 283 days. But in the 109th session (2005-06) it met for 247 days, which is 36 days fewer.",
      "In fact, the current session is slated to have more days than the 105th, 106th, 107th and 108th Congresses as well.",
      "We found the same pattern in the Senate, which has met, or is scheduled to meet, for 156 days this year. It didn't matter whether we looked at projected days this year or actual days last year. Since 2000, there were at least six years the Senate met fewer times.",

    "body-text": [
      "The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has a rule about how third-party candidates can make it into the fall debates: They need to reach an average of at least 15 percent support in five preselected national polls.",
      "No third-party candidate is on track to meet that requirement yet, but the Libertarian Party ticket of Gary Johnson and William Weld thinks it has a shot, and they're putting on a big push to make participation in the debates a reality.",
      "As part of their effort, Weld recently sought to harness the support of voters who may not be confirmed backers of their ticket but who do at least want to see third-party candidates on the debate stage.",
      "\"The mission of the Commission on Debates is to educate people about the presidential election,\" Weld wrote recently during a Reddit Ask Me Anything session he participated in with Johnson. \"76 percent of all voters in the United States say they want Johnson-Weld, by name, in the presidential debates. End of argument.\"",
      "Weld later made the same point in a CNN interview with host Michael Smerconish on Sept. 10, saying, \"It's very easy to say we should be included in the debates when 76 percent of the people in the United States say they want us in the debates.\"",
      "It turns out that Weld has a point, but he misstated some key details. The Johnson-Weld campaign did not reply to an inquiry for this article.",
      "The 76 percent figure comes from a Suffolk University poll conducted for USA Today and released Sept. 1. Here's the relevant question:",
      "",
      "So Weld was on to something. However, it's worth noting a few pieces of missing context.",
      "First, Weld said that voters in the poll wanted the ticket \"by name,\" but that's not correct. The question asked, \"If a third-party candidate is certified by a majority of state ballots, should he or she be included in the debates this fall?\"",
      "Second, Weld said, \"76 percent of all voters in the United States.\" In reality, the poll didn't sample \"all voters\" -- or even all registered voters. It sampled 1,000 likely voters. Pollsters, especially as Election Day draws near, sometimes use methods, such as respondents' past voting histories, to filter out the voters who are \"likely\" to vote.",
      "So Weld's description of the Suffolk poll data overstates the case a bit.",
      "And there's another issue: We found two other polls that specifically mentioned either Johnson-Weld or Johnson alone, and their figures were lower than the one Suffolk found.",
      "One is a poll by the web publication Morning Consult that surveyed 2,002 registered voters.",
      "It asked, \"Should Gary Johnson be included in the presidential debates?\" The poll found that 52 percent said yes, 22 percent said no and 26 percent didn't know or had no opinion. (The same poll asked a similar question of Green Party candidate Jill Stein and found 47 percent support for her inclusion in the debates.)",
      "",
      "The other poll was of 1,498 likely voters by Quinnipiac University on August 25.",
      "It asked, \"Do you think that Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate for president, should be included in the presidential debates this year, or not?\" This poll found that 62 percent said yes, 29 percent said no and 9 percent didn't know or didn't answer.",
      "So the other two polls that did mention Johnson by name found lower percentages of support for Johnson's participation in the debates, though both still found majority support.",
      "David Paleologos, the director of the Suffolk poll, generally agreed that Weld's statement left out some important information.",
      "\"The question was directed to the process of being certified on a majority of state ballots rather than introducing names,\" he said.",
      "He added, though, that the campaign might have some grounds to argue that the poll implicitly refers to them since they are currently the only campaign that will be on all 50 state ballots.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Weld said that \"76 percent of all voters in the United States say they want Johnson-Weld, by name, in the presidential debates.\"",
      "Weld can point to recent a poll with that 76 percent figure, but his description of what it means isn't entirely correct. It's a poll of likely voters, not \"all voters in the United States,\" and the question didn't mention Johnson or Weld \"by name.\" However, a majority of voters do support Johnson's inclusion in the debates -- a finding that holds in three recent polls on this question",
      "Weld's talking point is onto something, but his phrasing misses nuance and overstates the case. So we rate the statement Half True."

      "Conway made a point to tell Camerota and viewers that the Donald J. Trump foundation's money comes from Trump. But that's at odds at reporting we've seen, so we wanted to take a deeper look.",
      "Trump has yet to release his tax returns or provide evidence of his charitable giving, so it's impossible to know how much he's directly donated. The Washington Post's David Fahrenthold has been trying to track down Trump's donations for months with little success.",
      "Fahrenthold has determined, however, how much money Trump has donated to his foundation by reviewing the foundation's IRS documents. Based on his reporting, Conway's claim is inaccurate.",
      "\"Donald J. Trump Foundation is Trump's money, his campaign manager says. No,\" Fahrenthold wrote in a Washington Post article.",
      "We reviewed the Trump Foundation Form 990s ourselves and verified Fahrenthold's conclusion.",
      "From 1987, when Trump created the foundation to donate some of his Art of the Deal proceeds, to 2006, Trump was its main contributor. In those three decades, his gifts averaged about $250,000, with the largest one reaching $1 million in 1989.",
      "In 2007, Trump gave $35,000, which accounted for about 0.9 percent of the total donations received that year (World Wrestling Entertainment alone gave $4 million). In 2008, he gave $30,000. And then he stopped giving altogether.",
      "Here are two charts showing how Trump's donations to his foundation compare to others' gifts:",
      "",
      "What about the possibility that the money the foundation currently has still belongs to Trump? Fahrenthold told us that doesn't add up.",
      "\"Trump Foundation began 2007 with just $4,238 in the bank. That wasn't all Trump's money, but for the sake of argument let's assume it was. Since then, the available tax records show Trump has given just $65,000, and nothing since 2008. Other donors have given $8.9 million in that time, covering 2007 to 2014,\" he said.",
      "By 1995, a year after the foundation received its first non-Trump donation, the Republican nominee's own money actually stopped being enough to cover his foundation's charitable giving. And by 2014, the Trump Foundation had given a total of $13.5 million dollars while Trump himself had given it a total of $5.4 million.",
      "",

      "Well, it turns out he did say that climate change is a \"hoax\" of Chinese origin as we've found in previous fact-checks.",
      "On Nov. 6, 2012, Trump tweeted, \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\"",
      "",
      "So Trump clearly did say, at least once, that climate change was a Chinese hoax.",
      "The subject of this 2012 tweet came up during a Jan. 18, 2016, episode of Fox & Friends. In that interview, Trump indicated the tweet was a joke.",
      "\"Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax,\" Trump said. \"A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change. I'd be received environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn't care less. They have very you know, their standards are nothing. But they in the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it's very hard on our business.\" (Emphasis added.)",
      "Trump may call the mention of China's role a joke, but he certainly has a lengthy record of using the word \"hoax\" to describe climate change. (For the record, in 2014 we rated a claim that climate change is a \"hoax\" Pants on Fire.)",
      "Here are a few examples:",
      "On Dec. 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., \"Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean, it's a money-making industry, okay? It's a hoax, a lot of it.\"",
      "On Jan. 25, 2014, Trump tweeted, \"NBC News just called it the great freeze coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?\"",

      "On Jan. 29, 2014, Trump tweeted: \"Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!\"",
      "",
      "That same day, he tweeted, \"Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense.\"",

      "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said in a stump speech that immigration is a national security issue, and he criticized Hillary Clinton for refugee policies that he says will make the country less safe.",
      "\"Altogether, Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term, alone, with no effective way to screen or vet them,\" Trump said Sept. 20. \"Her plan would cost $400 billion in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs.\"",
      "We decided to look into Clinton's plan and its costs. We found that Trump is doing some embellishing.",
      "Refugee math",
      "Clinton has not laid out a four-year plan for refugees as Trump described. She's actually only talked about how many refugees should have been admitted for a single year.",
      "Clinton called President Barack Obama's plan to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016 a good start in a September 2015 interview on CBS Face the Nation, but she said the \"United States has to do more.\" She suggested admitting 65,000 refugees, amounting to a 550 percent increase.",
      "We asked Clinton's campaign how many refugees her administration would admit in the future and how much it would cost, but a spokesman said they had no new details.",
      "Trump's campaign referenced a June 2016 analysis of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, chaired by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., a Trump supporter.",
      "It makes the assumption that Clinton would bring in 155,000 refugees each fiscal year, totaling 620,000 in four years.",
      "Here's the subcommittee's math:",
      "It finds that Clinton would increase Syrian refugee admissions by 55,000. (Her suggestion of 65,000 minus Obama's 10,000 for 2016).",
      "To determine how many total refugees Clinton would admit per year, it adds 55,000 to 100,000 -- the Obama administration's previously stated refugee admission goal for fiscal year 2017. (He recently raised it to 110,000.)",
      "To conclude how many total refugees Clinton would admit in her first term, it multiplies 155,000 times 4 (total years in a presidential term) to total 620,000 refugees.",
      "The vetting process",
      "The United States has a refugee vetting process, and Clinton has not said she would move away from it. In fact, she's stressed the vetting process in public remarks, including at a November 2015 speech about national security at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"Our highest priority, of course, must always be protecting the American people,\" Clinton said. \"So yes, we do need to be vigilant in screening and vetting any refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security professionals in close coordination with our allies and partners.\"",
      "Congress needs to make sure resources are available for background checks and a close look should be placed on visa programs, she said.",
      "There's no precise dollar amount specified on Clinton's immigration reform page on her website. It says Clinton would create a national Office of Immigrant Affairs and \"support affordable integration services through $15 million in new grant funding.\"",
      "'$400 billion in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs'",
      "This summer, Trump said \"for the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.\" We rated that claim Pants on Fire.",
      "In that fact-check, we noted that the Obama administration requested under $2.2 billion for refugee and entrant assistance for fiscal year 2017, when the goal was 100,000 refugees.",
      "If Clinton tripled the requested amount for refugee funding in fiscal year 2017 and multiplied it over a 4-year term, it would not reach anywhere near Trump's $400 billion claim.",
      "However, in its June analysis, the Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest said the annual budget for refugee resettlement does not encompass all costs, including those related to refugees who qualify for public assistance programs such as Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Supplemental Security Income.",
      "That budget also leaves out social services costs at local and state governments and costs of future benefits once refugees become lawful permanent residents and U.S. citizens, the analysis said.",
      "\"The true lifetime cost of admitting a single refugee must include an accounting of all benefits received by that refugee -- at the federal, state, and local levels, and over the course of that refugee's lifespan,\" the analysis said. \"Any other calculation is akin to saying that the total cost of owning a new car is encapsulated in the down payment.\"",
      "Refugees come to the United States legally and are required to apply for lawful permanent residence a year after their arrival. But they also contribute to the economy.",
      "Refugees are qualified to get Social Security cards and are authorized to work. And like U.S. citizens, they have to pay employment, property, sales and other taxes, such as Social Security and Medicare.",
      "\"The only way to arrive at the large negative effects that Trump claims is to adopt the belief that refugees neither work nor pay taxes after they arrive,\" said Michael Clemens, an expert on migration and a senior fellow at Center for Global Development. \"That is untrue, and a method of counting only fiscal outflows while ignoring fiscal inflows is not a method that would be countenanced by any respected economist.\"",
      "Based on estimates from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, as well as data from Health and Human Services, a reasonably conservative figure for the total short-term, gross fiscal burden of each refugee is around $22,000, Clemens said. But that's not the long-term net fiscal impact, he said.",
      "\"The lifetime fiscal effect of a refugee admission -- including the tax revenue they are likely to generate over the course of their working lives, and both the up-front cost of assisting them and the other government services they are likely to use, is likely to be small and positive,\" Clemens said, citing studies that found refugees tend to perform better in the labor market than non-refugee immigrants over the long-term.",
      "At a minimum, the true costs of refugees is disputed and hard to put an exact figure on.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said, \"Altogether, Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term, alone, with no effective way to screen or vet them. Her plan would cost $400 billion in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs.\"",
      "Clinton has not said she would bring anywhere near that number; that's an extrapolation put together by the Trump campaign. Additionally, there are established protocols for screening and vetting refugees. Finally, the $400 billion figure only looks at potential benefits refugees might draw on without considering their economic output or taxes they might pay.",
      "Overall, we rate Trump's statement False."

      "After years of repeating conspiracies that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, Donald Trump finally backed away from the so-called birther movement earlier this month.",
      "But that didn't stop the question from coming up during a key exchange at Monday's presidential debate in New York.",
      "Hillary Clinton said Trump embraced a \"racist lie\" and it demonstrated a pattern that carried over from his business practices.",
      "\"Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans,\" she said.",
      "That's quite the charge, but is it true?",
      "Yes. It turns out he was.",
      "In 1973, Trump, as a 27-year-old, was president of his father's realty company, Trump Management. It operated nearly 40 apartment buildings, mostly in New York City. By all accounts, including his own, Trump was a hands-on president and very active in managing the day-to-day business operations.",
      "That year, the federal government filed a complaint against Trump, his father Fred Trump, and Trump Management. The complaint alleged that the Trumps violated the Fair Housing Act, part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, by discriminating against tenants and potential tenants based on their race.",
      "\"The defendants, through the actions of their agents and employees, have discriminated against persons because of race in the operation of their apartment buildings,\" the complaint reads.",
      "Black people, the government found, were often told a Trump Management complex had no availability when apartments were available for rent.",
      "In one instance, a black man asked about two-bedroom apartments at Trump's Westminster complex in Brooklyn on March 18, 1972, and a superintendent told him nothing was available. On March 19, 1972, the black man's wife, who was white, visited the complex and was offered an application for a two-bedroom apartment on the spot.",
      "The government lawyers also interviewed several people who said executives for Trump Management discouraged rental agents from renting to black people. In one case, the government said the company's comptroller instructed a rental agent to attach a sheet of paper that said \"C\" for \"colored\" to every application submitted by a person of color.",
      "Trump vehemently denied the claims, which he called \"absolutely ridiculous,\" according to a 1973 New York Times article. Trump and his company filed a countersuit the following December, claiming the government made baseless charges and asking for $100 million in damages. The court dismissed the countersuit.",
      "Trump's campaign did not respond to our requests for comment. But he did offer an explanation in the debate.",
      "\"As far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued,\" Trump said. \"We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do.\"",
      "Indeed, both parties settled in 1975 after a protracted legal battle. Trump claimed victory, writing in his 1987 memoir, Art of the Deal: \"In the end, the government couldn't prove its case, and we ended up taking a minor settlement without admitting any guilt\"",
      "However, under the agreement, Trump Management had to train employees about their obligations under the Fair Housing Act and to launch a two-year marketing program to inform the community about their fair housing practices, including giving a weekly list of vacancies to the New York Urban League, among other requirements.",
      "It's also worth noting that most of these suits are typically settled and often quickly -- \"north of 98 percent,\" Robert Schwemm, law professor at the University of Kentucky and an expert in housing discrimination law, previously told PolitiFact. And in every settlement, the agreement allows the defendant to take voluntary action to remedy the problem without admitting guilt.",
      "\"That doesn't mean there wasn't lots of evidence\" against Trump, Schwemm said.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Clinton said that Trump \"started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans.\"",
      "Both parts of the statement are carefully worded and accurate. The Justice Department sued Trump, his father and their company under the Civil Rights Act in 1973. In many instances, the government said, prospective black tenants were blocked from renting in his buildings.",

I am committed to doing whatever it takes to win this election, and ultimately become President because our country cannot afford four more years of the failed Obama-Clinton policies which have endangered our financial and physical security.\"",

      "In his first 13 weeks as president, Donald Trump spent more than half of his weekends away from the White House.",
      "Trump's frequent visits to his Palm Beach, Fla., club inspired a liberal political nonprofit to create a website with a catchy URL: IsTrumpAtMarALago.org.",
      "The website, built by the Center for American Progress Action Fund, allows users to compare the steep cost of Trump's trips to the cost of providing various public services, like school lunches.",
      "The fine print appears, at first blush, to back up the eye-popping amount.",
      "\"A trip to Mar-a-Lago costs taxpayers approximately $3.6 million, according to a Government Accountability Office report,\" the website says.",
      "We've seen similar estimates of Trump's travel costs pop up on various news and media sites. Nearly every one can be traced back to a single GAO report from October 2016.",
      "The GAO is an independent, reputable federal agency that researches how the government spends money.",
      "But this report doesn't exactly back up what the critics are saying, even if it's the best available estimate of a presidential trip to Palm Beach.",
      "The report did not estimate the specific costs of Trump's weekend escapes to the so-called Southern White House, though a reader would get that impression.",
      "Instead, the report, titled \"Presidential Travel: Estimated Costs for a Specific Presidential Trip to Illinois and Florida,\" found that a four-day trip President Barack Obama took to Chicago and Palm Beach in February 2013 cost approximately $3.6 million.",
      "It's not fair to assume that those costs are typical for presidential travel, the author of the report told us.",
      "Nor should we assume that Obama's 2013 trip and Trump's 2017 trips have similar price tags, even though both presidents went to Palm Beach.",
      "\"We wouldn't recommend substituting the numbers from President Obama's trip to any other trip,\" said Brian Lepore, director of defense capabilities and management at GAO.",
      "Here's why.",
      "When the president travels, generally several military aircraft are involved. These include Air Force One, carrying the president, his entourage and guests, cargo planes packing motorcade limousines and other equipment, and aircraft to transport personnel who conduct security sweeps before the president arrives.",
      "This is the main driver of presidential travel costs. Air Force One alone costs nearly $180,000 per hour of flight as of 2012, according to the Congressional Research Service. The GAO report found that total air and boat support accounted for more than 85 percent of the $3.6 million spent on Obama's 2013 trip.",
      "But these costs change significantly from trip to trip, so it's hard to nail down the average cost.",
      "For example, a president could take two identical weekend trips to Palm Beach, both trips requiring a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. But one trip could cost a good deal more than the other depending on where the C-130 has to fly in from. Military logistics could mean that one week it comes from Delaware, the next from Texas.",
      "Or, if the president's event schedule for one of the Palm Beach weekends requires a helicopter, an additional or bigger plane might be necessary to transport the helicopter.",
      "Other details can, on a smaller scale, affect the cost to taxpayers from trip to trip, such as the number of staff traveling with the president or the number of venues that need a security sweep. Or if the trip is for a non-official political event or vacation, the president and others traveling with him reimburse the government for some of the costs.",
      "This is not all to say that Trump's traveling isn't expensive or unusual.",
      "And as of week 13, Trump has spent 25 days away from the White House at another private residence, while past presidents spent far less at the same point in their term. Obama spent four days away; George W. Bush, 14 days; and Bill Clinton, zero days, according to the New York Times.",
      "And beyond Trump himself, the government is spending at least hundreds of thousands of dollars protecting Trump's family, including first lady Melania Trump who's currently living in New York City with their son Barron, and sons Donald and Eric as they travel around the world on business.",
      "But it's wrong to assume that the Mar-a-Lago trips cost the same as a specific trip Obama took to two cities over four days in 2013, based on this one GAO report.",
      "Corey Ciorciari, policy and research director at the Center for American Progress Action Fund, acknowledged this but said he's still comfortable with $3.6 million as a reasonable, if not conservative, estimate for the cost of one of Trump's Mar-a-Lago trips.",
      "He said some of the Mar-a-Lago trips could cost even more than $3.6 million because they involved foreign leaders, like Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, while the 2013 Obama trip did not.",
      "Unfortunately, this GAO report is the only recent official report on presidential travel costs. The next-best thing we came across was a GAO report from 1999 about trips President Bill Clinton took to Africa, Chile and China.",
      "Judicial Watch, a conservative-leaning organization that has sued both Democratic and Republican administrations, estimated that the Obama administration spent more than $96 million over his eight years on presidential travel, based on records they obtained from the military and Secret Service.

      "MS-13 history and growth predates Obama policy",
      "Violent gangs, including MS-13, were forming in U.S. cities long before Obama's presidency.",
      "MS-13 grew out of poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s. (The name Mara Salvatrucha comes from the word \"mara\" which is a term for gang, \"salva\" for El Salvador and \"trucha,\" which is slang for clever.)",

      "By the end of the 1990s, the United States government recognized that MS-13 posed a significant criminal threat. Amid an immigration crackdown toward the end of Bill Clinton's presidency, the government launched an effort to deport foreign-born residents convicted of crimes, including gang members.",

      "The Obama administration in 2014 announced a series of new programs and partnerships with Central American countries to address the issues driving their migration. The Central American Minors program allowed certain parents with lawful presence in the United States to petition for their children in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to come in as refugees. Children ineligible for admission as refugees but at risk of harm could be admitted under parole. The program was expanded in 2016 to allow additional family members to apply.",
      "No data on MS-13 removals under Trump",
      "Trump lauded his administration's enforcement efforts in a Fox News interview that aired shortly after his tweet.",

They are getting the hell out, or they are going to prison.\"",

So we don't understand why Democrats are now playing politics just because Donald Trump is in office.\"",
      "Mulvaney is referencing their votes on an act that authorized a fence, but as we've noted several times in the past, the 2006 fence was less ambitious than the wall Trump is proposing.",
      "The Secure Fence Act of 2006",
      "The Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President George W. Bush, authorized about 700 miles of fencing along certain stretches of land between the border of the United States and Mexico.",
      "The act also authorized the use of more vehicle barriers, checkpoints and lighting to curb illegal immigration, and the use of advanced technology such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles.",
      "At the time the act was being considered, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer were all members of the Senate. (Schumer of New York is now the Senate minority leader.)",
      "Obama, Clinton, Schumer and 23 other Democratic senators voted in favor of the act when it passed in the Senate by a vote of 80 to 19.",
      "Originally, the act called on the Department of Homeland Security to install at least two layers of reinforced fencing along some stretches of the border. That was amended later, however, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, which got rid of the double-layer requirement.",
      "Currently, 702 miles of fencing separates the United States from Mexico, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "So how does that compare to Trump's wall?",
      "Trump plans for the wall are vague, but here's what we know.",
      "He said the wall doesn't need to run the nearly 2,000 miles of the border, but about 1,000 miles because of natural barriers. He said it could cost between $8 billion and $12 billion, be made of precast concrete, and rise 35 to 40 feet, or 50 feet, or higher.",
      "Experts have repeatedly told PolitiFact that the differences in semantics between a wall and a fence are not too significant because both block people.",
      "Still, there are obvious differences between the fence and Trump's wall proposal.",
      "A 2016 Associated Press report from the border described \"rust-colored thick bars\" that form \"teeth-like slats\" 18 feet high. \"There are miles of gaps between segments and openings in the fence itself,\" the report said.",
      "Trump criticized the 2006 fence as too modest during the 2016 campaign.",
      "\"Now we got lucky because it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall, no, they couldn't get their environmental -- probably a snake was in the way or a toad,\" Trump said. (Actually, the project didn't face environmental hurdles; we rated that part of the claim Mostly False.)",
      "It's also worth noting that the political context surrounding the 2006 vote was different, too.",
      "Democrats normally in favor of looser immigration laws saw the Secure Fence Act of 2006 as the lesser of two evils, according to a Boston Globe report that detailed the legislative process. Around that same time, the House passed legislation that would make any undocumented immigrant a felon.",
      "\"It didn't have anywhere near the gravity of harm,\" Angela Kelley, who in 2006 was the legislative director for the National Immigration Forum, told the Boston Globe. \"It was hard to vote against it because who is going to vote against a secure fence? And it was benign compared with what was out there.\"",

      "As he neared the end of his first 100 days in office, President Donald Trump touted his first three months as a rousing success.",
      "\"No administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days,\" Trump told an audience in Kenosha, Wis.",
      "That's a pretty high bar, especially for an administration that has registered historically low levels of support in public-approval polls for presidents this early in their terms.",
      "The White House didn't respond to an inquiry for this article, but when asked about some of the president's 100-day accomplishments during the April 19 press briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer cited a series of executive orders, including some on regulatory reform; a drop in border crossings; and job creation. He said more details would be offered as the 100-day mark approached.",
      "We interviewed historians and considered the 100-day track records of presidents back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. While there's a lot of nuance in gauging accomplishments, Trump doesn't have much evidence to back up his boast that his administration has accomplished the most.",
      "First, some caveats",
      "All presidencies are different, and there's an especially big difference between those that began after an election and those that got their start suddenly. The latter category includes presidents who took over after the death of their predecessor (such as Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson) or their predecessor's resignation (Gerald Ford).",
      "In addition, it's easier for a president to put points on the board quickly if they enter office in the midst of a national crisis. This was true for Roosevelt (the Great Depression), Truman (the end of World War II), Ford (the Watergate scandal), and Barack Obama (the Great Recession). Without a crisis, Congress is less likely to act quickly.",
      "Perhaps most notably, there is widespread agreement among historians that the 100-day standard is arbitrary. Just because a president signs a significant law outside the 100-day window doesn't make it less of an accomplishment.",
      "For instance, Johnson and Ronald Reagan \"laid the groundwork for gigantic accomplishments\" such as on civil rights and taxes, respectively, that fell outside the 100-day window, said Princeton University historian Sean Wilentz.",
      "And both Truman and Dwight Eisenhower were preoccupied with wars during their first 100 days, said Max J. Skidmore, a University of Missouri-Kansas City political scientist who has written several books on the presidency. This meant they \"did not have much in the way of legislative achievements during that period,\" Skidmore said.",
      "All in all, \"most presidents have not considered 100 days a significant milepost,\" said H.W. Brands, a presidential historian at the University of Texas-Austin whose books include Traitor to His Class: The Privileged Life and Radical Presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. \"It's largely a media thing.\"",
      "The numbers",
      "Let's start with the raw numbers, Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker did some calculations comparing Trump's bill-signing output to that of his predecessors during their first 100 days.",
      "The Post counted 28 bills signed by Trump -- the highest since 1949, but well below the 76 signed by Roosevelt in 1933. Moreover, many of Trump's bills were \"minor or housekeeping bills,\" and none met a longstanding political-science standard for \"major bills.\" By contrast, at least nine of Roosevelt's did.",
      "Meanwhile, by the time of the Kenosha speech, Trump had signed 24 executive orders, 22 presidential memorandums, and 20 proclamations, the Post noted.",
      "Some of these started the ball rolling to overturn federal regulations. While these may eventually have a significant impact, it's worth noting that many new presidents routinely issue orders during their first 100 days that overturn actions of their predecessors of the opposite party.",
      "For instance, just two days after taking office, President Bill Clinton signed orders overturning restrictions on abortion imposed during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, and with equal speed, President George W. Bush overturned Clinton's opposition to a ban on aid to international groups that participate in abortions.",
      "\"Everyone does that, so it doesn't give him a comparative edge,\" said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University historian who has written books about Presidents Richard Nixon and Calvin Coolidge.",
      "Trump's accomplishments",
      "Historians we checked with mostly agreed that Trump's appointment of Neil Gorsuch to fill a Supreme Court vacancy was a significant event, and one that could influence public policy long after Trump leaves the White House.",
      "That said, some cautioned against making too much of Gorsuch's confirmation, arguing that it followed the nearly year-long blockage of Obama nominee Merrick Garland by the Republican Senate. \"It was really (Senate Majority Leader Mitch) McConnell's achievement,\" said Jeff Shesol, author of books on Roosevelt and Johnson and a former speechwriter for Clinton.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's military actions -- his missile strikes on Syria and the dropping of an unusually large bomb on an ISIS bunker -- are hardly unprecedented for a president's first 100 days. George W. Bush attacked Iraqi radar sites to enforce a no-fly zone, and Obama pledged to double the number of U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan.",
      "Trump's decision to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement echoes George W. Bush's decision to pull out of the Kyoto Protocol on curbing global warming. And the Trump administration's successful effort to win the release of Aya Hijazi, an American aid worker jailed for three years in Egypt on dubious charges, isn't unprecedented either. Moments after taking office in 1981, Ronald Reagan announced the imminent freeing of American hostages held in Iran for over a year.",
      "Several historians said Trump has faced some significant setbacks as well. His first big legislative push -- to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act -- stalled without even a final vote, and he has been slower than his predecessors in making sub-cabinet appointments. Trump also failed to submit a detailed budget proposal of the kind his predecessors had typically submitted by now.",
      "Then there's Trump's immigration ban, which would likely count as a major accomplishment if it's enacted, but which is frozen for now. It was issued, blocked by the courts, rewritten, and then blocked again.",
      "\"The fact that he has gotten so little done while having Republican majorities in both houses of Congress is a terrible indictment,\" Shesol said.",
      "The champion: FDR",
      "The 100-day record of just one president -- Franklin Roosevelt -- would be enough to cast doubt on the accuracy of Trump's claim that no administration has accomplished more.",
      "The 15 major bills Roosevelt signed included those that created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority (both of which still exist) and the Home Owners Loan Corp. He signed the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which established farm subsidies, and the National Industrial Recovery Act, which started public-works efforts to reverse the Great Depression. He signed legislation to legalize the manufacture and sale of beer and wine, and he issued executive orders to establish the Civilian Conservation Corps and to effectively take the United States off the gold standard.",
      "All in all, Roosevelt pushed the federal government to take a much bigger role than it had previously, said Adam Cohen, author of Nothing to Fear: FDR's Inner Circle and the Hundred Days That Created Modern America.",
      "\"When FDR took office, the banking system had collapsed,\" Cohen said. \"His emergency banking act got the banks open again and the system up and running. He got the Securities Act of 1933 enacted. It was the first major federal regulation of the stock market, which laid the groundwork for the kind of government regulation we now take for granted.\"",
      "Other presidents' 100-day achievements",
      "Other presidents have chalked up significant achievements as well.",
      "Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act, while Obama signed not only a nearly $800 billion stimulus package to combat a spiraling recession but also the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and a law expanding the Children's Health Insurance Program. He also implemented two urgent economic programs formally passed in the final weeks of George W. Bush's presidency -- the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the auto industry bailout.",
      "",
      "Other presidents have taken executive actions at least as significant as Trump's. Kennedy established the Peace Corps (later ratified by Congress). Ford, meanwhile, pardoned his predecessor, Nixon, and offered amnesty to Vietnam War draft dodgers.",
      "Truman's first 100 days were a whirlwind of foreign-policy actions -- the end of World War II in Europe, the writing of the United Nations charter, the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan, and Japan's unconditional surrender.",
      "Sometimes, a president's biggest accomplishment is intangible. Roosevelt calmed a nation gut-punched by the Depression, while Johnson reassured Americans after the shock of Kennedy's assassination.",
      "\"The main accomplishment of LBJ's first 100 days -- and this should not be discounted just because it did not involve a bunch of bill signings -- was to give the nation and its government a sense of stability and continuity after one of the most wrenching events of the century,\" said his biographer, Shesol.",
      "Evaluating Trump's 100 days",
      "One of the biggest impacts of Trump's first 100 days may fall into this \"intangible\" category.",
      "\"Even if there are not many major tangible accomplishments, his administration has changed the political and cultural trajectory of the country -- not as much as FDR did following Herbert Hoover, but more than the average new president does,\" Cohen said. \"It has been somewhat amorphous and hard to quantify, but it is certainly something many Americans are feeling.\"",
      "John Frendreis, a political scientist at Loyola University in Chicago, said Trump's 100 days seem most similar to Clinton's, which were also disorganized, short of focus and marked by the failure to pass an economic stimulus package. That said, he added, \"it is instructive to note that Clinton's presidency turned out to be reasonably successful after this rocky start, so this suggests a similar turn-around is possible for Trump.\"",
      "Whatever happens down the road, Trump, like his predecessors, is getting a dose of reality, Brands said.",
      "\"The big story of Trump's 100 days is how much reality has intruded on his notions of what a president can accomplish,\" he said. \"Every newcomer to the White House is sobered by the experience. Trump had more sobering to do to most.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said, \"No administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days.\"",
      "Trump has had some achievements in office, but at the very least, they are much less numerous and far-reaching than those of Roosevelt, the standard against whom all presidents are measured. In more recent years, other presidents, including Obama, have accomplished more in their first 100 days than Trump has, historians say. We rate the claim False."

      "This made us wonder. Is that true?",
      "Long story short, this claim is accurate when you compare the percentage of nonwhite males and women combined to the percentage of white males in each cabinet. However, if you look at each factor separately, Trump's cabinet remains the most white, but not the most male.",
      "The president's first cabinets",
      "As evidence of this claim, the Center for American Progress' tweet linked to a New York Times article that reached a similar conclusion about Trump's first cabinet.",
      "The New York Times story was updated on March 10, 2017, and compares Trump's first cabinet to the first cabinets of former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and of course Ronald Reagan.",
      "The analysis was first written when Trump's cabinet wasn't fully assembled, so, it assumes Trump's remaining nominees would be confirmed.",
      "The New York Times included R. Alexander Acosta, Trump's second nominee for labor secretary, and to the best of our knowledge Trump's cabinet has remained unchanged since this time.",
      "It's worth pointing out that the New York Times analysis included traditional cabinet positions as well as \"cabinet-level\" positions. Cabinet-level positions have changed over time. (Trump has 24 cabinet members, whereas George H.W. Bush only had 17).",
      "\"Some positions, such as the United Nations ambassador and the Office of Management and Budget director, are given cabinet-level rank by individual presidents but are not traditionally considered part of the cabinet,\" the article says.",
      "Furthermore, some traditional cabinet positions were created since Reagan took office. For example, the Department of Homeland Security didn't get created until 2003 and the Department of Veterans Affairs did not exist in its current form until George H.W. Bush's presidency.",
      "For these reasons, the total number of people in each president's first cabinet varies.",
      "So, with those factors in mind, how white and male is Trump's cabinet?",
      "According to the New York Times, 18 of Trump's 24 cabinet members are white males.",
      "The only minorities and women in Trump's cabinet are:",
      "Elaine L. Chao, transportation secretary;",
      "Betsy DeVos, education secretary;",
      "Nikki R. Haley, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations;",
      "Linda McMahon, administrator of the Small Business Administration;",
      "Ben Carson, housing and urban development secretary; and,",
      "R. Alexander Acosta, labor secretary.",
      "That means 75 percent of Trump's first cabinet is white males.",
      "A smaller percentage of white males were in Obama's, W. Bush's and Clinton's first cabinets based on the same analysis.",
      "The only other president who challenges Trump's standing is George H.W. Bush, whose first cabinet was 71 percent white male. But Bush had fewer cabinet members, according to the New York Times' article. So, the percentage of nonwhite and women cabinet members combined in his cabinet is higher than Trump's cabinet.",
      "But looking at each demographic individually white and male changes the picture.",
      "Trump's cabinet has a higer percentage of white males out of any first cabinet since Reagan, but he does not have the highest percentage of males.",
      "That distinction belongs to George H.W. Bush whose cabinet was 89 percent male. Females makes up a little more than 16 percent of Trump's cabinet, but only made up 11 percent of George H.W. Bush's.",
      "You have to go back to Reagan to find a more white and more male cabinet. White males comprised 90 percent of his first cabinet. (It's worth noting Reagan had 17 white males to Trump's 18. Reagan's cabinet is considered less diverse, though, because he had even less people in his cabinet.)",
      "The idea that Trump's cabinet lacks diversity has been widely reported on, especially when confirmation hearings and appointments were being made.",
      "During that time, a CNN report noted that Trump's four most influential departments are led by white males, which is a first since George H.W. Bush.",
      "Those include former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson (secretary of state), retired Marine Gen. James Mattis (secretary of defense), Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions (attorney general), and ex-Goldman Sachs banker Steve Mnuchin (secretary of the treasury).",
      "Our ruling",
      "In a tweet, American Progress said, \"Trump's Cabinet is more white and more male than any first Cabinet since President Ronald Reagan's.\"",
      "That claim is based on a credible New York Times analysis that found that Trump's first cabinet had a smaller percentage of women and nonwhites combined than any president since Reagan. When you look at each demographic separately, however, George H.W. Bush has the most male cabinet.",

      "The graphic said, \"Over 500,000 new jobs -- with a surge in female employment last month.\"",
      "Is that accurate? Not exactly.",
      "",
      "'Over 500,000 new jobs'",
      "The number of new jobs does exceed 500,000 if you include the monthly job reports from January, February, and March -- the most recent three months for which data has been released. The net gain in jobs over that period was 533,000.",
      "However, there's a problem with Trump claiming credit for all 533,000 jobs -- namely, the January report isn't based on job gains that occurred on his watch.",
      "\"The jobs report is a snapshot reflecting conditions in the calendar week or pay period that includes the 12th of the month,\" said Jed Kolko, chief economist with the jobs site Indeed. Since Trump was sworn in on Jan. 20, \"the information in the January report preceded President Trump's first 100 days,\" Kolko said.",
      "Using just the two months on his watch -- February and March -- the U.S. economy created 317,000 jobs, not 500,000.",
      "A fair approximation, Kolko said, would be to include job growth reported in the February, March, and April reports. But the April jobs report hasn't been released, so we don't know the final number yet.",
      "For the sake of comparison, overall job creation under Trump actually hasn't been turbo-charged yet. The average monthly gain for February and March -- the two months for which we currently have data for Trump -- was 158,500.",
      "By contrast, the average monthly gain for Obama's final full year -- January 2016 to December 2016 -- was 187,000. Here's a chart showing monthly job gains since January 2016.",
      "\"Job gains so far this year are not exceptional by the standards of job growth in the recent past,\" said Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless. \"My assessment is that not much has happened so far in the job market, in either a favorable or unfavorable direction, since the start of the year.\"",
      "We'll also add our usual caveat that that no president deserves full credit or full blame for economic performance on their watch, since no president is powerful enough to singlehandedly shape the economy. Other forces, from technological advances to developments overseas, can have significant effects.",
      "'A surge in female employment last month'",
      "As for the \"surge\" in female employment, there is evidence in the statistics, but it's not clear how significant or durable the increase is.",
      "The number of employed women rose by 475,000 between February 2017 and March 2017. That's bigger than all but one month-over-month increase in 2016, when Obama was in office, and it followed a January-to-February increase of 319,000.",
      "There's uncertainty, however, about what, if anything this means.",
      "For starters, most economists warn that it's vastly preferable to draw conclusions from more than one month. One month's statistics could be thrown off balance by random quirks; this shortcoming would dissipate if you looked at a longer run of months.",
      "In addition, the month-to-month data for men's and women's employment tends to bounce around -- a lot. During the final full year of Obama's presidency, the monthly change in women's employment ranged from a decline of 179,000 to an increase of 487,000, and the monthly change in men's employment ranged from a decline of 94,000 to an increase of 402,000.",
      "This is part of why economists favor a different Bureau of Labor Statistics measurement for month-to-month changes in employment -- a survey of company payroll records, rather than of households. The payroll-survey data did not vary as widely under Obama in 2016 -- it ranged from a gain of 43,000 to a gain of 291,000. Indeed, the payroll data showed a gain of 98,000 jobs in March, which doesn't align at all with the supposed 475,000-job increase for women seen in the household survey.",
      "It's also worth noting that the March gain for women was partially offset by a loss of 5,000 jobs for men.",
      "\"We'll have to wait a while longer before knowing whether the big March employment gains for women are significant or sustainable,\" Burtless said. \"Most informed observers agree that the month-to-month and even two-month employment changes recorded in the household survey seem awfully variable compared with the numbers in the employer survey.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said he created \"over 500,000 new jobs -- with a surge in female employment last month.\"",
      "Actually, he can stake a claim for a boost of 317,000 jobs at most, not 500,000 -- and that comes with the usual caveats about how much credit presidents deserve for job growth during their tenure. Meanwhile, the data does show a two-month surge in female employment, but it's too soon to know whether this is a lasting achievement or just statistical noise.",

      "Counting the number of laws he's signed, President Donald Trump has been more productive in his first 100 days than any president since Harry Truman, according to press secretary Sean Spicer.",
      "\"Despite the historic obstruction by Senate Democrats, he's worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman, and these bills deliver on some of his most significant promises to the American people,\" Spicer said at the White House daily press briefing April 25.",
      "This is a new assessment of Trump's output so far from the White House; Trump previously, wrongly, said no administration had accomplished as much as he did, period.",
      "Trump has signed 28 bills so far. Spicer's correct that this is more than every president going back about 70 years.",
      "However, this isn't a perfect measure primarily because not all bills are created equal. None of the bills Trump has signed into law are particularly significant.",
      "The numbers",
      "Truman signed 55 bills in his first 100 days after his 1948 election. (Truman first became president in 1945, when Franklin D. Roosevelt died in office. So we're starting with the first 100 days of Truman's first full term.)",
      "No president since Truman has signed as many bills in his first 100 days, according to data from GovTrack and research by political scientists John Frendreis, Raymond Tatalovich and Jon Schaff.",
      "The next highest after Trump, who has signed 28 bills, was John F. Kennedy, who signed 26. The lowest was George W. Bush, who signed seven.",
      "No president comes close to Roosevelt, who began the tradition of marking the first 100 days. He signed 76.",
      "Note on the chart: For presidents Jimmy Carter through Trump, we did our own count using GovTrack. For earlier presidents, we used data confirmed by Frendreis, a political science professor at Loyola University Chicago. For Lyndon Johnson and Truman, who both came into office to replace a president midterm, we used the first 100 days after their re-election. We left out Gerald Ford because he did not serve a full term.",
      "Of the post-Truman presidents, Trump is \"fairly typical\" in terms of the number of bills signed so far, Frendreis said.",
      "The bills",
      "Spicer says that Trump has shepherded these bills through Congress. However, the 28 bills aren't very significant and don't appear to have required vote whipping from the White House.",
      "For example, three bills appoint individuals to the Smithsonian Institution board, two name buildings, and one designates a location for a National Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial.",
      "The most notable bills Trump has signed are a set of 13 that reverse Obama-era regulations on a range of issues including on internet privacy and gun control. While that was a goal for Republican lawmakers, it's important to note these bills made it to Trump's desk through a process made possible by the Congressional Review Act, which became law in 1996. The act gives Congress a narrow window to reverse regulations, so these 13 bills had to get through Congress within Trump's first 100 days.",
      "Notably missing from the list of 28 bills that have reached his desk: A bill repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, along with several other laws Trump said he would try to usher through Congress within his first 100 days.",
      "Compare this to President Barack Obama, who signed 14 laws, but those laws included the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and the $800 billion stimulus package.",
      "Or Roosevelt, who within 100 days signed 15 major bills including the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which established farm subsidies, and the National Industrial Recovery Act, which started public-works efforts to reverse the Great Depression. He signed bills that legalized the manufacture and sale of beer and wine and established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority.",
      "This doesn't necessarily reflect badly on Trump. Generally speaking, it's rare for a president to sign major legislation in his first 100 days, Frendreis said. \"Outsider\" presidents like Trump, in particular, need time to learn how to navigate the lawmaking process in Washington, and major legislation doesn't move through Congress quickly.",
      "The first 100 days is \"not necessarily an accurate reflection of how effective a president is going to be in leading Congress,\" he said.",

      "In the first 100 days of his first full term, Truman signed 55 bills. The president with the highest count since then is Trump with 28.",

      "Sebastian Gorka, a deputy assistant to President Donald Trump, is none too fond of the terrorism-fighting approach of former President Barack Obama. He made this clear during an Aug. 8 interview on MSNBC.",
      "\"There's no such thing as a lone wolf,\" Gorka said. \"You do know that. That was a phrase invented by the last administration to make Americans stupid. There has never been a serious attack or a serious plot that was unconnected from ISIS or al-Qaida. At least through the ideology and the TTPs, the tactics, the training, the techniques and the procedures, that they supply through the internet. Never happened. It's bogus.\"",
      "However, Gorka's assertions are flawed, several terrorism experts told PolitiFact. (The White House did not provide any additional explanation in response to an inquiry.)",
      "The lone wolf as a metaphor for independent terrorism clearly pre-dated the Obama administration. We'll also note that Gorka's claim that there has \"never\" been a serious plot unconnected from ISIS or al-Qaida is dubious.",
      "This is easily debunked. Just look at a few of the books that used the term in the context of terrorism before Obama took office in January 2009:",
      "Brian T. Bennett, Understanding, Assessing, and Responding to Terrorism: Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Personnel, 2007: \"Lone wolf terrorism involves individual extremists who usually operate alone or on the fringes of established extremist groups, inflicting serious harm or causing significant damage.\"",
      "Jeffrey F. Addicott, Winning the War on Terror: Legal and Policy Lessons from the Past, 2002: \"Because they operate on their own, without affiliation to any known group or state, individuals who engage in lone-wolf terrorism' are far harder to predict, track, or deter.\"",
      "Linda Jacobs Altman, Hate and Racist Groups: A Hot Issue, 2001: \"The lone wolf and leaderless cell became part of the new face of racist terrorism in the 1990s.\"",
      "In addition, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 amended the definition of an \"agent of a foreign power\" to include a \"lone wolf\" category. The provision was widely known as the \"lone wolf\" amendment.",
      "So, how far back does the term go? Experts said that its specific application to terrorism originated with the ideas of white nationalist Louis Beam, who in the early 1980s advocated \"leaderless resistance.\" Tom Metzger, the founder of the group White Aryan Resistance, advocated a similar approach.",
      "The idea \"was adopted by American right-wing extremists in response to a federal law enforcement crackdown on domestic terrorists during the 1980s,\" said Mark Hamm, an Indiana State University criminologist who coauthored the book The Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism. \"Leaderless resistance is based on the idea that a terrorist group, no matter how secret or well-organized, simply cannot evade law enforcement, so terrorism is more readily accomplished by individual actors rather than a group.\"",
      "In 1998, FBI agents in San Diego opened \"Operation Lone Wolf\" -- an investigation into the criminal activities of a self-proclaimed white supremacist, Alex Curtis. The following year, a widely noted New York Times article was headlined, \"New Face of Terror Crimes: 'Lone Wolf' Weaned on Hate.\"",
      "Over the next few years, the term became increasingly associated with terrorism of all stripes and was used by government officials, academics, and the media.",
      "\"The reason was obvious: There were numerous sporadic terrorist attacks carried out by individuals and small groups,\" said George Michael, a criminologist at Westfield State University and author of Lone Wolf Terror and the Rise of Leaderless Resistance. \"Furthermore, many of the perpetrators had little or no connections to terrorist movements.\"",
      "So while the term \"lone wolf\" was used increasingly during Obama's presidency, its application to terrorism was already decades old, and it was not \"invented\" by the administration.",
      "Analyzing this statement requires a bit more nuance, so we won't factor it into our rating. But the claim is still problematic, experts said.",
      "On the most basic level, there have been countless of terrorist attacks that have nothing to do with Islamic radicalism -- starting with the white nationalist movements that helped promulgate the term \"lone wolf\" in the first place. Other examples of terrorism, stemming from a variety of motives, include the 16 lethal bombings by Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski between 1978 and 1995, the Oklahoma City bombing by Timothy McVeigh in 1995, and the series of bombings by Olympic Games bomber Eric Rudolph between 1996 and 1998.",
      "Meanwhile, across the globe, \"there are a range of attacks by lone perpetrators that are tied to ethnic rather than religious causes, and not all were Islamic by a long shot,\" said Jeffrey Kaplan, a terrorism specialist who is starting a posting at King Fahd Defense College in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and who co-authored the book, Lone Wolf and Autonomous Cell Terrorism.",
      "Even limiting the universe to post 9/11 attacks with Muslim perpetrators produces some exceptions to Gorka's firm \"never,\" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. He cited two attacks without apparent links to al-Qaida or ISIS:",
      "On July 4, 2002, Hesham Mohamed Hadayet opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport, killing two and injuring four. Hadayet, a 41-year-old Egyptian national, died after being shot by an airport security guard. The FBI concluded that Hadayet's killing spree was a terrorist act, but that he acted alone and hoped to influence U.S. government policy toward Palestine.",
      "On July 28, 2006, Naveed Afzal Haq killed one woman and injured five others at the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle. A witness told the Associated Press that Haq declared himself \"a Muslim American, angry at Israel\" before opening fire. FBI officials said he was not acting part of a terrorist group, but \"acting out some kind of antagonism toward this particular organization.\" The attack was ultimately classified as a hate crime by the county prosecutor.",
      "Gartenstein-Ross said he's sympathetic to Gorka's broader skepticism about the impact of lone wolves. For starters, there is evidence from a recent University of Miami study that online pro-ISIS groups have highly fluid memberships, suggesting that true lone wolves -- people acting genuinely on their own without any interactions with like-minded individuals, online or otherwise -- are rare in the Internet age.",
      "Experts have cautioned that overuse of the term \"lone wolf\" may even be hampering investigations. \"When you systematically describe attackers as lone wolves, you sometimes end up missing the networks they were connected to,\" Gartenstein-Ross said.",
      "Gorka said, \"There's no such thing as a lone wolf. ... That was a phrase invented by the last administration to make Americans stupid.\"",
      "Contrary to what Gorka said, the concept of the lone wolf terrorist predates the Obama administration by decades. We found the term widely used by government officials, academics, and the media, all before Obama took office.",

      "On the eve of his first-place finish in the Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama, Roy Moore -- a former Alabama judge who advocated for the display of the Ten Commandments -- attracted some attention for a comment he made about Muslim Sharia law.",
      "Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life, including religious practice, daily living, crime and financial dealings, but Muslims differ on its interpretation.",
      "Some commentators, particularly on the right, have warned that Sharia poses a threat to the United States' legal system. But PolitiFact has debunked a string of claims about the influence of Sharia law (or aspects of it) in the United States, including by retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who became President Donald Trump's short-lived national security adviser.",
      "Moore made his comments during a campaign stop to meet with members of the pro-gun group BamaCarry Inc. There, reporter Jeff Stein of the website Vox.com asked him, \"Some right-wing conservatives think Sharia law is a danger to America -- do you?\"",
      "Moore responded, \"There are communities under Sharia law right now in our country. Up in Illinois. Christian communities; I don't know if they may be Muslim communities. But Sharia law is a little different from American law. It is founded on religious concepts.\"",
      "Stein pressed Moore to name the communities under Sharia law. He responded, \"Well, there's Sharia law, as I understand it, in Illinois, Indiana -- up there. I don't know.\"",
      "Later in the interview, Stein tried again, asking Moore to be specific and name which communities he was referring to. Moore said, \"I was informed that there were. But if they're not, it doesn't matter. Sharia law incorporates Muslim law into the law. That's not what we do. We do not punish people according to the Christian precepts of our faith -- so there's a difference.\"",
      "So are there really entire communities that ignore U.S. law and operate instead under Sharia law?",
      "We found zero evidence of it. (We did not hear back from the Moore campaign.)",
      "The office of the Illinois attorney general told PolitiFact that there are \"no communities under Sharia law\" in the state. Experts were equally dubious.",
      "\"Seriously, I've never heard of any such thing,\" said Nathan J. Brown, director of George Washington University's Institute for Middle East Studies and a specialist on the rule of law in the Arab world. \"I suspect the only accurate part of his statement is when he confesses, I don't know.' \"",
      "Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na im, an Emory University law professor, was equally skeptical.",
      "\"I have not seen evidence of entire communities being run by Sharia law anywhere in the United States,\" An-Na im said. In fact, \"it is legally impossible for any community anywhere in the United States to be under Sharia law' simply because for that to happen, Sharia law must be enacted as the law of the state, and that is unconstitutional under the First Amendment.\"",
      "Specifically, the First Amendment \"allows for accommodation but not establishment,\" said Cyra Akila Choudhury, a law professor at Florida International University. \"So, private groups may choose to abide by religious law, such as Jews who abide by judgments made by rabbinical courts and Muslims who might abide by a decision made by their Sharia council or imam. But to assert that Sharia is being enforced by the state is entirely incorrect.\"",
      "That exception -- the use of religious law to settle intra-community disputes between consenting parties, outside of the United States legal system -- is sometimes a source of confusion for critics of Sharia law, experts said.",
      "\"If Muslims choose to abide by Sharia as a private matter with regard to the practice of their religion, it is protected by the Constitution insofar as the practice does not contravene the laws of the land,\" Choudhury said. \"So, for example, Sharia principles of criminal law would not be given accommodation. Or, if you marry in the United States, your religious ceremony may not be recognized unless you have a state license and conform to the state's requirements.\"",
      "Aryeh Tuchman, associate director of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, agreed that his group knows of no such Sharia-ruled communities.",
      "Making such a suggestion, he added, \"feeds into the fear that Muslims are attempting to impose their laws on others in our country. Individual Muslims and their families may voluntarily observe Sharia-related rituals, but this is no different from Jews or Christians living their lives in accordance with the dictates of their own religious traditions.\"",
      "Tuchman suggested that Moore might have been mistakenly referring to a satirical column published in the Daily Beast in 2015. The column, written by Muslim-American radio host and comedian Dean Obeidallah, was headlined, \"Next, We Muslims Bring Sharia to Indiana.\" It poked fun at Indiana, which was facing criticism for a new religious-liberty law signed by then-Gov. Mike Pence, now the vice president.",
      "In the column, Obeidallah jokingly floated ways that Muslims could take advantage of a law that was mostly supported by conservative Christians.",
      "\"Some might be asking, could Muslims really impose Sharia law in some fashion in Indiana -- turning Indiana into a mini Muslim caliphate?\" he wrote. \"Well, the Indiana law doesn't just provide religious liberty' for Christians. It provides liberty' for all faiths, and that includes us Muslims. There are now so many things we can do in Indiana that we are not able to do in the rest of America,\" from taking more than one wife to requiring that restaurants institute halal-compliant rules.",
      "When we brought Moore's comments to Obeidallah's attention, he responded, \"LOL.\"",
      "",
      "Moore said, \"There are communities under Sharia law right now in our country. Up in Illinois. ... There's Sharia law, as I understand it, in Illinois, Indiana up there. I don't know.\"",
      "After checking with multiple experts, we found no evidence of such a community. What we did find was a satirical Daily Beast article headlined, \"Next, We Muslims Bring Sharia to Indiana.\" We rate Moore's statement Pants on Fire."

      "After a terrorist deliberately crashed a van into a crowd of people in Barcelona on Aug. 17, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to condemn the attack. He then suggested that the world should get tougher on terrorism.",
      "\"The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong, we love you!,\" Trump tweeted.",
      "He later followed up, writing: \"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\"",
      "The person who needs a lesson, however, is Trump.",
      "Trump has made this claim about U.S. Army Gen. John Joseph \"Black Jack\" Pershing before. During a Feb. 19, 2016, rally in North Charleston, S.C., Trump referred to an anecdote from the aftermath of the Philippine-American War of 1899-1902, when the United States sought to exert its authority over the Asian archipelago, which it had recently obtained from Spain after winning the Spanish-American War.",
      "After taking the reins of power from Spain, the United States faced armed opposition, and the three-year war led to the deaths of more than 4,200 American combatants, more than 20,000 Filipino combatants, and as many as 200,000 Filipino civilians, according to the State Department.",
      "After the war, Pershing served as governor of the heavily Muslim Moro Province between 1909 and 1913. This period was notable for its continuing insurgencies.",
      "\"They were having terrorism problems, just like we do,\" Trump said, according to a February 2016 account in the Washington Post. \"And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs' blood you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn't a problem.\"",
      "In Trump's most-recent telling, 25 years became 35 years.",
      "But either way, neither version of the story adds up.",
      "",
      "The idea that pig's blood could serve as a weapon against Muslims has been around in popular culture for decades.",
      "For instance, a 1939 Hollywood movie, The Real Glory, stars Gary Cooper as a doctor on the Philippine island of Mindanao who drapes a captive in pigskin \"to serve as an abject lesson to all would-be attackers,\" Luis H. Francia, a Filipino-born professor of Asian American Studies at Hunter College, wrote recently.",
      "The best evidence U.S. troops used pigs as a tactic against Muslims comes from a memoir by Pershing titled My Life Before the World War, 1860-1917, which was republished in 2013 by the University Press of Kentucky. In the memoir, Pershing writes that another commanding officer in the Philippines, Col. Frank West, had in at least one case seen to it that bodies of Muslim insurgents \"were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig. It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins.\"",
      "In a footnote, the editor of the 2013 edition, John T. Greenwood, cited a letter about the incident from Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell, the commander of the Philippines Division, to Pershing: \"Of course there is nothing to be done, but I understand it has long been a custom to bury (insurgents) with pigs when they kill Americans. I think this a good plan, for if anything will discourage the (insurgents) it is the prospect of going to hell instead of to heaven. You can rely on me to stand by you in maintaining this custom. It is the only possible thing we can do to discourage crazy fanatics.\"",
      "While these writings do provide strong evidence that United States forces used pigs as a tactic against Muslim insurgents, there is no evidence that Pershing himself committed these acts.",
      "Experts have been skeptical the practice was widespread or directly authorized or ordered by Pershing.",
      "\"This story is a fabrication and has long been discredited,\" said Brian McAllister Linn, a Texas A&M University historian and author of Guardians of Empire: The U.S. Army and the Pacific, 1902-1940. \"I am amazed it is still making the rounds.\"",
      "Christopher Einolf, a professor at DePaul University and author of America in the Philippines, 1899-1902: The First Torture Scandal, added that he trusted the conclusion of the late military historian Frank E. Vandiver, who told About.com in 2003 that \"I never found any indication that it was true in extensive research on his Moro experiences. This kind of thing would have run completely against his character.\"",
      "Indeed, other historians noted that Pershing pursued a less brutal approach to \"pacifying\" the rebels in the southern Philippines than Leonard Wood, one of his predecessors.",
      "\"He did a lot of what we would call winning hearts and minds' and embraced reforms which helped end their resistance,\" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. \"He fought too, but only when he had to, and only against tribes or bands that just wouldn't negotiate with him. He wasn't solely committed to fighting as people like Trump who tell the pig blood story imply.\"",
      "Another wrinkle: Historians said the premise that the rebels would have been motivated by a fear of pigs is not as certain as Trump suggests. It's unclear how religiously observant the insurgents were and whether such a policy would have made a difference in their actions.",
      "\"The Moros were fighting for a lot of reasons, not just because they were Muslims,\" Janda said. \"This is another fact that gets lost in many modern discussions of terrorism.\"",
      "To many of the historians we checked with, the idea that Pershing's actions stopped \"radical Islamic terror\" was actually the bigger problem with Trump's parable.",
      "\"Even if the tale is true, the pacifying effect that Trump claims is nonsense,\" said Michael H. Hunt, an emeritus historian at the University of North Carolina and author of Arc of Empire: America's Wars in Asia from the Philippines to Vietnam. The region \"remained in constant unrest during the period of American rule and into the period of independence, right down to the present.\"",
      "Silbey of Cornell agreed. \"Where Trump's remark becomes ridiculous is in the idea that this actually worked,\" he said. \"The Moro War did not end until 1913, and even that's a bit of a soft date, with violence continuing for quite a while afterward. Defilement by pig's blood isn't -- and wasn't -- some magical method of ending terrorism.\"",
      "If anything, a more complete account of the Moro insurgency involves some subplots that run contrary to Trump's narrative.",
      "\"The Ottomans under Sultan Abdul Hamid II sent a letter to the Sulu Moros asking them not to resist the Americans at the start of the Moro Rebellion, and the Moros on Sulu complied,\" Janda said. \"It's a nice example of diplomacy working to our advantage, and a reminder that then and now, not all Muslims or Moros are the same and that many were and are U.S. allies.\"",
      "Trump said that Pershing stopped \"radical Islamic terror\" for 35 years. Of the eight historians we checked with the first time we heard Trump speak about Pershing, all were at least skeptical that the specific tales of Pershing actually took place, and some expressed disbelief even more forcefully than that.",
      "But more critically, the historians took issue with Trump's suggestion that the tactic -- if it was even used at all -- actually worked to end tensions, noting that unrest persisted for years. Trump's claim rates Pants on Fire."

      "Cruz said he enthusiastically backed aid for Sandy's victims, but the problem was the particular bill.",
      "\"It became a $50 billion bill that was filled with unrelated pork,\" Cruz said Aug. 28. \"Two-thirds of the bill had nothing to do with Sandy. And what I said then and still believe now is it's not right for politicians to exploit a disaster and people who are hurting, for them to pay for their own political wishlist.\"",
      "Did two-thirds of the Sandy money have nothing to do with that storm?",
      "No. There was some padding, but the data and the assessment of those who studied the bill say the extras amounted to far less than Cruz stated.",
      "Cruz's office sent us its breakout of the 2013 Disaster Relief Appropriations Act to support the assertion that \"nearly 70 percent\" was \"used for non-emergency spending.\"",
      "Before we dive into a couple of the big items on that list, it's important to note that Cruz said the bulk of the money had nothing to do with Sandy. That's considerably stronger than saying the money went for \"non-emergency spending.\"",
      "In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy devastated portions of the Mid-Atlantic coast. Congress responded by adding nearly $10 billion to the National Flood Insurance Program. It then passed a relief bill for five times that amount.",
      "The bigger package passed without the support of Cruz and most other Republicans.",
      "Of the $50.5 billion dollars that Congress appropriated, Cruz's office cited a Congressional Quarterly article that said $17 billion went for \"immediate aid and $33.5 billion for near- and long-term assistance and mitigation.\"",
      "The list from Cruz highlighted $16 billion to the Housing and Urban Development Department's Community Development Fund. (The actual figure is $15.2 billion according to a spreadsheet from the Recovery and Accountability Board, the agency created to oversee recession recovery spending.)",
      "Cruz's office said that included \"any major disaster declarations from 2011, 2012 and 2013.\"",
      "While that might raise concern that the money would go elsewhere, in reality, the funds largely went to the states hit by Sandy. According to HUD, $12.8 billion has been granted to New Jersey, New York and New York City. Add in other east coast states where Sandy did damage -- Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island -- and the total reaches $13 billion.",
      "So you could argue that the bucket leaked, but not nearly on the scale flagged by Cruz's office.",
      "The other large chunk of funds was $10.9 billion for mass transit reconstruction. That money has been slow to get out the door. The Recovery Board had just $3.7 billion granted and a bit under $1 billion spent as of March 2015. But that doesn't prove that the money had nothing to do with Sandy.",
      "The Federal Transit Administration told state officials in 2013 that \"funds are for specific areas (counties) in 12 states designated as disaster areas for Hurricane Sandy.\"",
      "The Government Accountability Office, the auditing arm of Congress, assessed the transit relief program in 2014. It said \"transit projects can take years to complete. Furthermore, Federal Transit Administration plans to use nearly half of its Disaster Relief Appropriations Act appropriation for resiliency projects (or projects to protect facilities from future damage).\" The GAO noted that the funding guidelines allow \"transit agencies to improve facilities beyond pre-disaster conditions.\"",
      "This supports the criticism that the money would go beyond immediate disaster relief, but as the report noted, large-scale construction projects have long runways.",
      "Taken together, these two buckets of money account for about $24 billion of the $33 billion that was the basis for Cruz saying most of the money was unrelated to Sandy.",
      "Two people who analyze disaster relief spending said Cruz was off the mark.",
      "\"Two-thirds would be a gross overestimate,\" said Robert Young, a Western Carolina University geologist. \"There was clearly extraneous spending, but no way it was two-thirds.\"",
      "The advocacy group Taxpayers for Common Sense assembled a body of data on spending related to Sandy. The group's vice president Steve Ellis said no matter how you look at the numbers, two-thirds of the funds \"are definitely Sandy related.\"",
      "Ellis said the bigger issue wasn't pork barrel spending, rather that the bill passed outside of the regular budget process.",
      "\"It really depends on how you think about emergency,\" Ellis said. \"Two years after Sandy only a fraction of the money had been spent. We would like to see a more deliberative approach to disaster rather than strike while the iron is hot.\"",
      "Cruz said that two-thirds of Hurricane Sandy relief money had nothing to do with Sandy.",
      "The numbers don't back that up. Cruz might have been focused on the difference between immediate emergency relief and longer term reconstruction, but his words skipped over that distinction.",

The court-funded program aimed to help troubled teens. A security camera recorded Tate bringing two 15-year-old girls into a conference room. He was not their assigned mentor. There was no tape of what took place inside the room. The two girls accused him of coercing them to touch him and each other sexually.",

      "Smith said Moore was telegraphing some sympathy for Tate's position, but again, this dissent alone did not amount to disagreeing with Tate's conviction.",
      "The ad raises two other cases to show Moore's \"disturbing conduct.\"",

      "In the ad's final example, Moore was the lone dissenter. The case involved a 17-year-old boy who performed a sexual act on a 4-year-old boy at a daycare center. The teen was convicted on two counts -- first-degree sodomy of a child under 12 and first-degree sodomy by forcible compulsion.",
      "Moore took issue with the second count, arguing that there was no evidence of an implied threat of serious physical injury or death in the case. The matter was made more complicated because the offender was under 18, which put him in a gray zone under state law. Moore argued that the court was going beyond what lawmakers had written.",

      "Did the Barack Obama administration ditch FBI material used to train counterterrorism agents?",
      "At a House committee hearing on worldwide terror threats, Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., claimed the former administration purged information that could \"allow us to see in totality the threat that faces America.\"",
      "\"Just curious if you can tell me if the FBI has taken any steps to reverse the previous administration's purge of training courses and information about Islamism, jihad, Sharia, and the Muslim Brotherhood,\" Perry asked FBI director Christopher Wray at the Nov. 30 hearing.",
      "Wray said he was not aware of efforts to purge training material.",
      "\"They were purged in the last administration,\" Perry told him.",
      "Is that true?",
      "Perry's office did not respond to our requests for information. We found the FBI did rescind training material during the Obama administration but it was less than 1 percent of 160,000 pages of training documents that were found to contain information that was factually inaccurate, imprecise or used stereotypes.",
      "The review came after media reports show that training material included claims identifying \"mainstream\" American Muslims as \"likely to be terrorist sympathizers.\"",
      "The Arab American Institute said the documents \"crudely\" depicted Arab Americans and American Muslims \"as threatening, irrational, or otherwise abnormal.\"",
      "Here's what we know about the FBI's review and rescinded documents.",
      "Wired in July 2011 reported that part of a January 2009 presentation for new FBI recruits said that Islam \"transforms (a) country's culture into 7th-century Arabian ways.\"",
      "Additional Wired reporting in September 2011 found that during a training session at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., agents were told that \"mainstream\" American Muslims were \"likely to be terrorist sympathizers; that the Prophet Mohammed was a cult leader'; and that the Islamic practice of giving charity is no more than a funding mechanism for combat'.\" A chart in the presentation contended that the more \"devout\" Muslims are, the likelier they are to be violent, Wired reported.",
      "The FBI distanced itself from the messages in the training.",
      "It told Wired that the presentation had a disclaimer saying the views expressed were of the author and \"do not necessarily reflect the views of the U.S. government.\" An FBI press release issued a day after Wired's report said the training segment was presented only one time and quickly discontinued.",
      "At a November 2011 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., asked then-Attorney General Eric Holder about the training material, presenting among examples a claim that the Arabic mind is swayed more by ideas than facts.\"",
      "\"It is regrettable that that information was, in fact, a part of a training program,\" Holder said, adding that there was an ongoing review of training material \"to ensure that that kind of misinformation\" was not being used, because it could undermine and negatively impact outreach efforts.",
      "The FBI reviewed 160,000 pages of material and eventually removed hundreds of pages from its training. Less than 1 percent of the material reviewed had \"factually inaccurate or imprecise information or used stereotypes,\" the FBI told Wired in February 2012.",
      "A March 2012 letter from Durbin to then-FBI Director Robert Mueller expressed disappointment that the FBI would not produce a written report on the material deemed inappropriate, and that it would not be publicly shared or given to Congress. Durbin's letter said FBI briefers shared copies of \"a handful\" of the material with Senate Judiciary Committee staff, but were not allowed to keep the copies.",
      "The FBI did not confirm to PolitiFact if it eliminated such material, but referred us to public source material and 2012 congressional testimony.",
      "At a May 2012 House Judiciary Committee hearing on oversight of the FBI, Mueller said 876 inappropriate training documents had been removed after a review of 160,000 documents and over 1,000 videos, but did not specify what the material said.",
      "Judicial Watch, a conservative group that litigates on public corruption and other issues, said documents it obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit showed that reasons cited for the removal of material included: \"Article is highly inflammatory and inaccurately argues the Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist organization,\" and \"author seems to conflate Islamic Militancy' with terrorism' and needs to define the difference and use it in their analysis.\"",
      "\"The excised material included references linking the Muslim Brotherhood to terrorism, tying al Qaeda to the 1993 World Trade Center and Khobar Towers bombings, and suggesting that young male immigrants of Middle Eastern appearance may fit the terrorist profile best',\" Judicial Watch said.",
      "Perry said the Obama administration purged \"training courses and information about Islamism, jihad, Sharia, and the Muslim Brotherhood.\"",
      "The FBI removed nearly 900 training documents containing information that was inaccurate, imprecise or depicted stereotypes, after a review of 160,000 pages and more than 1,000 videos. The review came after 2011 media reports about training material portraying Muslims stereotypically and prone to violence.",
      "Though the FBI did not publicly disclose the material it rescinded, Judicial Watch said that through a lawsuit for information, it found that removed material included references to the Muslim Brotherhood.",

      "President Donald Trump is known for boasting about his achievements. But is he correct that he's enacted more legislation than any other president?",
      "At a West Palm Beach fire station on Dec. 27, Trump said, \"You know, one of the things that people don't understand we have signed more legislation than anybody. We broke the record of Harry Truman.\"",
      "This was a variation on an earlier, Mostly True assertion by his former press secretary Sean Spicer that Trump has \"worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman.\"",
      "Eight months have passed since we rated Spicer's statement, so we -- and a lot of PolitiFact readers -- thought it was a good time to check Trump's most recent claim.",
      "The boast's accuracy has declined with time big time.",
      "According to calculations by govtrack.us-- a nonpartisan website that collects congressional and other governmental data -- Trump actually ranked last in legislation signed among post-World War II presidents in their first calendar year who took office on the regular four-year cycle (as opposed to those who were elevated to the presidency after a death or resignation).",
      "In a report published on Dec. 21, 2017, govtrack.us wrote that \"Trump has sunk to last place with 94 bills signed into law by his 336th day in office (today). That's eight fewer than President George W. Bush and not even half as many as presidents Bill Clinton (209) and George H.W. Bush (242).\"",
      "Trump signed two bills the day after the report was released, including a major tax bill, but that wouldn't be enough for him to catch up to George W. Bush. Through Dec. 28, Trump had signed 96 and the younger Bush had signed 109, Joshua Tauberer, the founder of Govtrack.us, told PolitiFact.",
      "Tauberer added that Truman signed at least 126 laws in his first 100 days, so his number for the full year would be far above Trump's current 96.",
      "Govtrack.us also looked at the number of pages signed, and Trump wasn't first on that list either. \"Trump's 2,038 pages put him in 4th place well behind Obama's 3,473 pages but more than twice as much as George W. Bush by this point in their first years,\" the report said.",
      "Trump's statement from West Palm Beach \"is wrong no matter how you try to repair it,\" Tauberer said.",
      "Here's a chart summarizing both measures, which doesn't include the two bills Trump signed on Dec. 22. In the chart, the presidents are ordered from most bills signed to least bills signed. Presidents Harry Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Gerald Ford aren't included in this comparison because they started their tenure in the middle of a congressional session.",
      "(It would not be appropriate to compare the three presidents who entered office other than on Jan 20 to the rest because each completed their first calendar year in office with much shorter tenures in the Oval Office. Johnson, for instance, would have had only a few weeks. Also, those presidents would not have come in with a popular mandate and a new Congress starting its work.)",

It shows that he moved into first place around Day 100 of his presidency, but fell to seventh place within the next two months, and slid down to tenth out of 10 as the end of his first calendar year approached.",
      "It's also worth noting that not all legislation is of equal importance. On the one hand, Trump has signed the tax overhaul, a bill of major consequence.

Still others have been ceremonial in nature, such the official naming of a federal courthouse in Tennessee or a commemorative coin for the American Legion. (Here's a full list.)",

      "He commented, \"Smart! 'Kuwait issues its own Trump-esque visa ban for five Muslim-majority countries.' \" The post linked to an article published on the English-language version of the Arabic-language website Al Bawaba on Feb. 1 that featured the headline Trump quoted in his post:",
      "",
      "But the government of Kuwait -- a small, Arab monarchy wedged between Iraq and Saudi Arabia on the Persian Gulf -- publicly rejected the notion that it had followed Trump's lead by banning travel by Muslims.",
      "Kuwait \"categorically denied media reports that it planned to stop issuing entry visas for some nationalities,\" read a statement from Sami Al-Hamad, Kuwait's assistant foreign minister for consular affairs. He added that \"citizens of those countries mentioned by social media visited Kuwait regularly through direct commercial flights.\"",
      "Other diplomats, including the Pakistani envoy in Kuwait and Kuwait's charge d'affaires in Iran, backed up Kuwait's statement.",
      "Kuwait's denial was picked up by such mainstream media outlets as Reuters. But as of the afternoon of Feb. 7, Trump's post remained up and uncorrected, as did the Al Bawaba article he had linked to.",
      "So what's going on here? The short answer is that Trump's Facebook post was wrong. The longer answer, however, needs to fill in some important background. (The White House did not provide PolitiFact with any backup material. Attempts to reach the Kuwaiti embassy in Washington were unsuccessful.)",
      "Travel restrictions for Kuwait happened years ago",
      "We found several news accounts from years ago that generally said Kuwait had banned visas for several Muslim countries in 2011 before easing the rules a bit in 2013.",
      "A Gulf News article dated May 22, 2011, said that \"Kuwait has banned nationals from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan from entering the country, local media reported. The ban includes suspending all tourism, visit and trade visas as well as visas sponsored by spouses, immigration sources said, quoted by Kuwaiti media yesterday.\"",
      "The article cited unnamed sources saying that the \"visa ban,\" which was described as \"temporary,\" stemmed from the \"difficult security conditions in the five countries\" and to \"the remarkably increasing tendency of nationals from the five countries to apply for visas to bring in relatives who faced or could face arrest by the local authorities to Kuwait.\"",
      "Another Gulf News article dated July 8, 2013, noted that Yemen was later added to the visa-ban list.",
      "The 2013 article noted that in January of that year, Kuwait \"eased\" the ban from those six countries by allowing public-sector workers to bring their wives and children with them, and by allowing private-sector workers to bring their sons if they were under 15 years old and their daughters if they were under 18.",
      "Finally, in 2014, Kuwait eased its visa rules -- but excluded Iran, Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Pakistan, or Afghanistan from those expanded rules.",
      "So, while Trump was wrong to say in his Facebook post that Kuwait had followed his lead, Kuwait did have restrictions in previous years.",
      "\"Historically, Kuwait has issued travel bans on certain nationalities due to specific events,\" said Edward W. Gnehm Jr., who studies the Gulf region at George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs. He noted that Kuwait banned entry by Palestinians, Yemenis and Iraqis after the liberation of Kuwait in 1991 since it considered those countries or their people to have been supportive of Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.",
      "That said, Kuwait has some practical restrictions on how firmly it can crack down on travel from these countries, said Kristin Smith Diwan, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.",
      "\"There are lots of Syrians living in Kuwait, and they certainly haven't been evicted,\" Diwan said. \"It also would have been very unpopular with Kuwaitis who had enormous sympathy for Syrians and the uprising, especially in the early part of the war.\"",
      "Diwan added that Kuwait \"has lots of business with both Iraq and Iran,\" making a total ban difficult. In fact, she said, the Kuwaiti Emir recently visited Iran to explore the potential for de-escalation on behalf of Kuwait and its neighbors.",
      "Another key point is that the immigration systems of the United States and Kuwait are akin to \"apples and oranges,\" said David Andrew Weinberg, a Gulf specialist at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.",
      "\"Kuwait, unlike the United States, is not a multiethnic democracy,\" Weinberg said. \"It is a family-ruled monarchy and ethnically-based nation that does not offer a route to citizenship to immigrants. In fact, Kuwait doesn't even grant citizenship to enormous numbers of bedoon' individuals who have been there for generations but aren't recognized as Kuwaiti' by the state.\"",
      "Estimates put the number of expatriates in Kuwait at more than 2 million, accounting for about two-thirds of the country's population and much of its workforce.",
      "In other words, Weinberg said, Kuwait, unlike the United States, doesn't have an immigration system for people to come and stay and become citizens. So any movement toward a stricter immigration policy would have much bigger consequences in the United States than in Kuwait.",
      "If you click through the Al Bawaba story that Trump linked to, that article sources its information to another article, from a London-based website called The New Arab. That article now includes a note at the bottom stating in part, \"This article has been updated to reflect the fact that the ban came into force, unofficially, in 2011, and was not a reaction to Donald Trump's recent executive order.\"",
      "So the original media source that Trump's post is based on doesn't even stand by the message of its original headline.",
      "Our ruling",
      "On Facebook, Trump said, \"Smart! 'Kuwait issues its own Trump-esque visa ban for five Muslim-majority countries.' \"",
      "That's wrong -- news coverage suggests that Kuwait implemented a visa ban on a half-dozen predominantly Muslim nations in 2011, six years before Trump took office.",
      "Meanwhile, any argument that Kuwait's past actions indicate a like-minded approach between Trump and Kuwait sidesteps the reality that pursuing such a policy in the United States inevitably has a much bigger impact because the U.S., unlike Kuwait, allows a path to citizenship for legal immigrants. We rate the statement Mostly False.",

      "President Donald Trump lashed out at CNN New Day anchor Chris Cuomo for failing to get tough with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D- Conn. Cuomo had interviewed Blumenthal after the senator made headlines by saying that Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch had told him he was \"disheartened\" by the president's dismissive comments about federal judges.",
      "Blumenthal drew Trump's wrath first. The president tweeted, \"Sen.Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie),now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?\"",
      "Cuomo's turn came next. After he spoke with Blumenthal, Trump tweeted on Feb. 9, 2017, \"Chris Cuomo, in his interview with Sen. Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave \"service\" in Vietnam. FAKE NEWS!\"",
      "Chris Cuomo, in his interview with Sen. Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave \"service\" in Vietnam. FAKE NEWS!",
      "Actually, Cuomo did ask about that.",
      "CNN posted Cuomo's interview with Blumenthal. Cuomo's first question was: \"What is your response to the president of the United States saying you should not be believed because you misrepresented your military record in the past?\"",
      "Blumenthal didn't answer the question. Instead, he repeated his account of what Gorsuch said to him. The interview moved on to details about the Gorsuch nomination.",
      "After Trump took his shot at Cuomo, the CNN anchor defended himself on air.",
      "\"The president, with all due respect, is once again off on the facts,\" Cuomo said. \"He just said, You never asked him about it.' I did. He ducked it, and that's okay. Politicians duck things all the time.\"",
      "\"The President ... is once again off on the facts\": @ChrisCuomo's response to @realDonaldTrump's tweet about him https://t.co/ckWo75HT8L",
      "We reached out to the White House for comment and did not hear back. If they do respond, we will update this fact-check.",
      "Vietnam legacy",
      "Both Blumenthal and Trump avoided serving in Vietnam, but while Trump never claimed to have been there, Blumenthal did.",
      "In 2010, the New York Times reported that at a 2008 ceremony for veterans and senior citizens, Blumenthal said, \"We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam.\" In 2003, Blumenthal spoke at a rally supporting troops overseas. \"When we returned, we saw nothing like this,\" he said, a comparison with soldiers who came back from Vietnam.",
      "Blumenthal told the New York Times he had \"misspoken\" about his Vietnam record. In reality, between 1965 and 1970, he received at least five deferments for military service. In 1970, he obtained a slot in the Marine Reserves and was stationed in America.",
      "As we've reported before, Trump benefited from four student deferments in college and one medical deferment (Trump later said that was for bone spurs in his heels), before being classified 4-F, unfit to serve. Trump played baseball, tennis and squash during his college years. He once said attending a private military-style boarding school gave him \"more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said Cuomo failed to ask Blumenthal about his \"long-term lie\" about his service in Vietnam. The video record shows that Cuomo asked Blumenthal to respond to the charge that he lacked credibility after misrepresenting his military record.",
      "Cuomo might not have mentioned Vietnam, but he certainly brought Blumenthal's past distortions into the conversation. Cuomo could have pressed Blumenthal with follow-up questions, which he failed to do. But he did ask.",

      "After the clip, Burnett asked Sanders if it's a \"problem\" that the president hasn't seen the report. That's when Sanders actually criticized Trump for his tendency to dismiss news outlets' negative reports as fake news.",

Trump and former Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who is helping Gorsuch through the confirmation process, both lost their races in the Granite State to Democrats.",
      "ABC's George Stephanopoulos repeatedly pressed Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller for evidence for Trump's statement multiple times in a Feb. 12 interview on This Week.",
      "\"I've actually, having worked before on a campaign in New Hampshire, I can tell you that this issue of busing voters in to New Hampshire is widely known by anyone who's worked in New Hampshire politics. It's very real, it's very serious,\" Miller said. \"This morning on this show is not the venue for me lay out all the evidence.\"",
      "Miller went on to talk about the administration's issue with people who are registered to vote in two states or illegal voters on voter rolls, repeating false talking points and never bringing up evidence to back up the administration's claim about a pipeline of bused-in voters in New Hampshire. (The White House did not provide evidence to back up the busing claim after Miller's interview and instead pointed to a 2014 editorial about the need for voter ID laws that did not mention busing.)",
      "We searched widely, as have others, and failed to find any evidence corroborating Miller and Trump's claim.",
      "Fergus Cullen, who ran the New Hampshire Republican Party from 2007-08, said the stories about voters coming over from Massachusetts are as old as \"the invention of the bus.\" What fuels the concern is New Hampshire's same-day voter registration law, even though it was adopted in the 1990s with strong Republican support to avoid the federal government's \"motor voter law,\" which allows people to register to vote at their DMV.",
      "\"The result is that yes, it is possible and legal for someone to drive into a polling place in a car with out-of-state tags, register to vote, and vote,\" Cullen told PolitiFact. \"Of course they have to sign affidavits and they would be risking significant legal penalties if they voted in more than one place or state. The odds of being caught are pretty high.\"",
      "He said the same theory was going around in New Hampshire in 2012, an election where Massachusetts Democrats were supporting Elizabeth Warren against incumbent Sen. Scott Brown.",
      "Adding more fuel to the talking point is that some Massachusetts residents do go to New Hampshire to help with that state's closer elections, said Dante Scala, a University of New Hampshire political scientist who has written books and articles about the state's elections over 15 years.",
      "\"So it certainly is possible on election day people from Massachusetts come north to work on the election itself,\" he said, \"but that's a far cry from proving that they vote here.\"",
      "Miller's claim has been analyzed by our colleagues at PolitiFact New Hampshire, who found no evidence busing exists. They rated a similar claim about Massachusetts residents boarding buses to vote in New Hampshire Pants on Fire.",
      "Chris Sununu, who won his bid for New Hampshire governor Nov. 8, warned ahead of the election that Democrats would bus in Massachusetts voters in places where elections are not close and assign them a fake address to apply for same-day voter registration in New Hampshire.",
      "That statement, like Miller's, was flawed. Aside from one to two cases per election, the top state elections official said widespread voter fraud is not a problem. \"I have no basis to say it's rampant, and there are ways we can deal with it,\" New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner said in an interview with PolitiFact New Hampshire.",
      "New Hampshire law requires voters to provide IDs at the polls. Without a proper ID there are added barriers and questions, as the voters sign a sworn affidavit with their address and get their photo taken. After the election, the state sends confirmation letters to those addresses to confirm identities. Letters that are returned as undeliverable are investigated.",
      "In Sununu's case, he eventually walked back much of his argument, saying he wasn't talking about literal buses of voters crossing into the state; rather it was a \"figure of speech that people are coming over, they're temporarily here, they vote and then they leave.\"",
      "The incident he had in mind was, he said, of Portsmouth state Sen. Martha Fuller Clark letting Democratic staffers live at her house during the 2008 and 2012 elections. The staffers voted in New Hampshire, using her address but that wasn't illegal, the state attorney general concluded, because they had lived in the state for at least three months before the election.",
      "After Trump's November victory, he continued to make claims of \"serious voter fraud\" in New Hampshire, Virginia or California. The claims rated Pants on Fire, Pants on Fire, and Pants on Fire.",
      "PolitiFact New Hampshire, in particular, talked to several state and local officials about whether anything fishy occurred Nov. 8. Nashua City Clerk Tricia Piecuch, who works in the state's second-largest city on the border with Massachusetts, said nothing out of the ordinary went down. Officials in the Secretary of State's office, Attorney General's office and U.S. Attorney's office all reported no complaints of voter fraud in the 2016 election.",
      "\"We have never gotten any proof about buses showing up at polling places,\" Gardner, a Democrat, told The Boston Globe. \"It's not in a private place. It's a public place.\"",
      "In response to reports about Trump's meeting with senators, FEC Commissioner Ellen L. Weintraub called on the president to \"immediately share his evidence with the public and with the appropriate law-enforcement authorities so that his allegations may be investigated promptly and thorougly.\"",

And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world,\" Trump said in a press conference Feb. 16. \"To me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, Oh, that's good.' Now it means, That's good for jobs.' Very different.\"",

      "All three major stock indexes closed at record highs for five days in row on Feb. 15. But does Trump get credit for that, as he suggested? Experts told us there are nuances.",
      "Stock market winning streaks",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average includes the stocks of the 30 largest and most powerful companies in the country (Wal-Mart, Disney, Pfizer, for example). The Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) consists of the 500 most commonly traded stocks and represents about 80 percent of the total value of U.S. stock markets. The Nasdaq Composite Index features mostly technology companies.",
      "All three major indexes on Feb. 15 closed at record highs for the fifth consecutive day.",
      "It was the first time the three indexes achieved concurrent high records for that length of time since January 1992, according to analyses reported by CNNMoney and MarketWatch.",
      "MarketWatch countered part of Trump's tweet, saying that the Feb. 15 high really wasn't \"the longest winning streak in decades.\"",
      "\"Rather, it's the best record-setting stretch in a quarter century In terms of winning streaks, the S&P has risen for seven consecutive trading days for its longest stretch of up days since September 2013, when it also rose for seven straight sessions. That's according to Dow Jones data,\" wrote MarketWatch's Victor Reklaitis, also noting Dow gains for five days straight and a Nasdaq seven-session winning streak. (More on the those winning streaks here and here.)",
      "Experts told us that investors are at least somewhat hopeful about Trump's promised tax and regulation cuts, though that's not the sole driver of the stock market highs.",
      "Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 30 directing that for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be eliminated. Trump says \"wasteful and unnecessary\" regulation kills jobs and stop businesses from growing.",
      "Trump also has promised to slash the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax.",
      "In meetings with CEOs of different industries, Trump has reiterated that tax cuts are coming and that he'd like to get rid of 75 percent of regulations, \"maybe more.\" He has also tweeted about a border tax for imports.",
      "\"I would definitely say Trump gets credit,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The S&P 500 returns are up 3.8 percent from Jan. 20, the day Trump took office, said Stovall, who has studied the market's returns during each president's first month dating back to President Herbert Hoover in 1929.",
      "Amid the recession and during Obama's first month in office in 2009, returns fell 9.4 percent, Stovall said. They rose 1.4 percent during Obama's first month in office in his second term, according to Stovall's study.",
      "Tim Duy, an economist and professor at the University of Oregon, said the economy was poised for relative strength as the end of 2016 approached, regardless of Trump's inauguration.",
      "\"Underlying growth remained solid, and it increasingly looked like some of the inventory overhang of the previous year was easing,\" Duy said. Manufacturing and services sector surveys were going up, and two factors that'd been weighing on stocks -- decline in oil prices and strength of the dollar -- waned over 2016, Duy added.",
      "\"The economy was not headed into a recession and, in the absence of a recession, stocks are more likely to go up than down,\" Duy said. \"In other words, this was largely baked into the cake regardless of who won the election. Trump was handed a solid economy at the macro level.\"",
      "It's still reasonable to believe that hopes of tax cuts have boosted stocks to some degree, but it wasn't the dominant factor, Duy said.",
      "Economic news has been nuanced in recent weeks.",
      "Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show 227,000 jobs were added in January 2017. The unemployment rate in January was 4.8 percent, slightly higher than the previous month but based on 584,000 more people looking for jobs after accounting for annual adjustments to population controls, according to Feb. 3 BLS figures.",
      "\"Consumer confidence decreased in January, after reaching a 15-year high in December,\" said in a Jan. 31 statement Lynn Franco, director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, which presents the Consumer Confidence Index based on a monthly survey.",
      "\"The decline in confidence was driven solely by a less optimistic outlook for business conditions, jobs, and especially consumers' income prospects. Consumers' assessment of current conditions, on the other hand, improved in January,\" Franco said. \"Despite the retreat in confidence, consumers remain confident that the economy will continue to expand in the coming months.\"",
      "Trump certainly isn't the first to boast about the stock market's performance.",
      "In 2015, Hillary Clinton claimed the stock market does better when there's a Democratic president. While several calculations backed her statement, we rated her claim Mostly True because experts said several other factors are key in determining performance, including timing, policies and international economic trends.",

      "But now Trump is assailing leaks from the intelligence community to the New York Times that led to the quick departure of Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn. The articles cited anonymous officials saying that during the presidential transition, Flynn had been in contact with Russia about the sanctions that had recently imposed by the Obama administration.",

      "He followed up with several tweets between Feb. 14 and 16, such as this one from Feb. 16: \"Leaking, and even illegal classified leaking, has been a big problem in Washington for years. Failing @nytimes (and others) must apologize!\"",

Pressed on the question at his Feb. 16 news conference, Trump drew a distinction between the release of classified information (the leaks on Flynn and Russia) and the release of personal emails (WikiLeaks and the Democratic National Committee).",
      "\"In one case, you're talking about highly classified information,\" Trump said. \"In the other case, you're talking about (DNC chairman) John Podesta saying bad things about the boss (Clinton). I will say this: If John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun. He said terrible things about her. But it wasn't classified information. But in one case, you're talking about classified (material).\"",
      "Trump has a point about the distinction. But that's not the whole story.",
      "Though the DNC releases weren't classified, Wikileaks has released classified information previously. That includes 750,000 pages of documents stolen by Chelsea Manning, then known as Bradley Manning.",
      "In other words, during the campaign Trump praised an organization that made its name by leaking classified information. Now he's criticizing leaking.",
      "\"He went from I love WikiLeaks,' an organization that publishes leaked classified information, to his current position,\" said Barnett Rubin, associate director of the Center on International Cooperation at New York University.",
      "\"A few months ago, leaks were getting him elected -- now they are destroying\" his presidency, agreed John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org.",
      "Robert F. Turner, associate director of the University of Virginia's Center for National Security Law, said he understands the distinction between leaking classified material and information that is merely private. He also made clear that he is almost always dead-set against leaking. Regardless of who makes or broadcasts the leak, \"good people die and freedom is placed in jeopardy,\" he said.",
      "However, Turner added that \"it seems clear to me that Russia was trying to influence the outcome of our election, which I view as a serious national security issue.\" If a disgruntled Democratic National Committee official had copied some documents and leaked them, \"I think Trump could have drawn a reasonable distinction between those garden variety disclosures of private information (arguably by whistleblowers') and disclosures derived from classified national security programs that were apparently disclosed by government employees in violation of their security agreements.\"",
      "However, \"because of the Russian role I don't think that distinction holds up,\" Turner said. \"Bottom line, I would call this a flip-flop.\"",
      "Other experts emphasized that a hack -- something Trump was on record supporting and even encouraging during the campaign -- is potentially worse than a leak.",
      "\"Information from a hack carried out by a foreign power with the intention of influencing or discrediting U.S. elections is much more serious than leaks of classified information intended to inform the public or influence policy,\" Rubin said.",
      "Benjamin H. Friedman, a research fellow in security studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, went even further.",
      "\"Trump has done something worse than flip-flop,\" he said. \"He's showed that his stance of leaks depends on whether it helps him. Flip-floppers change their mind; Trump has showed that he doesn't have a stance on leaks independent from his interests. He's pretending otherwise now, but it's not credible.\"",
      "Indeed, there's an example from Trump's somewhat more distant past that addressed this issue.",
      "On Oct. 30, 2013 -- long before Trump was an announced candidate for president -- he tweeted, \"ObamaCare is a disaster and Snowden is a spy who should be executed-but if it and he could reveal Obama's records,I might become a major fan.\"",
      "Trump may have been joking in this tweet. Still, it suggests that this dichotomy -- between leaks that help him and leaks that don't -- has crossed his mind before.",
      "Our ruling",
      "During the campaign, Trump praised WikiLeaks, an organization that exists to publicize private, and at times classified, information. Now, as president, he's criticizing federal officials who have leaked secret or classified information to the news media. Trump has a point that the leaked material from the DNC wasn't classified. Still, the underlying principle is the same: Trump was praising the release of private information during the campaign but criticizing it after he became president. The situations are substantially similar, but Trump's sentiments are not. We rate it a Full Flop."

      "Government intelligence agents have concluded that Russia tried to influence the presidential election in a way that favored Trump over Hillary Clinton. A leading reason for this conclusion is that Russian actors tried to access accounts belonging to both Democrats and Republicans through cyber intrusion, but they only widely disseminated significant information stolen from the Democrats.",

      "The Russians \"tried to hack the Republican National Committee, and they were unable to break through,\" Trump said.",

      "In a Kremlin-directed campaign, online con artists stole, then leaked, emails from Clinton campaign Chair John Podesta and the Democratic National Committee. The emails ended up being posted on WikiLeaks and other online sources. The leaks caused many headaches for the Clinton campaign and led to DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz's resignation.",
      "It's clear that Russian hackers did infiltrate some Republicans and affiliated groups. The website DC Leaks published about 200 emails related to Republican Party business, as well as the emails of former Secretary of State Colin Powell. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on CNN that Russian actors compromised his campaign emails.",

      "\"There was evidence that there was hacking directed at state level organizations, state level campaigns and the RNC, but old domains of the RNC,\" Comey said. \"That is, email domains that they were no longer using, and the information was harvested from there, but it was old stuff. None of that was released. We did not develop any evidence that the Trump campaign or the current RNC was successfully hacked.\"",
      "He added that the methods used to attack the RNC and DNC systems were similar. The Russian actors used a technique called phishing, meaning the cyber intruders sent emails designed to trick the recipient into clicking a link and giving over his or her email password.",
      "But Comey said the Russian attackers \"got far deeper and wider into\" the DNC, though he couldn't say why they didn't get into the current RNC system.",
      "Trump and other Republican leaders say that the hackers were unable to get into the RNC because of the organization's superior cyber defenses. While this is a plausible claim, we are unable to independently corroborate it.",
      "The RNC pointed us to the December Wall Street Journal article mentioned previously, which reported that \"intruders failed to get past security defenses on the RNC's computer networks.\" Additionally, the cyber intruders were much less aggressive in their attempts to penetrate the RNC than they were in their attacks against the DNC. This article is based on unnamed sources said to be close to the RNC and the intelligence investigation.",
      "The DNC, in contrast, did not have the most-advanced programs for detecting suspicious email traffic installed, and the organization was slow to respond to the FBI's warning that it had been hacked, reported the New York Times, in an article based on interviews with several on-the-record sources.",

      "There was a lot more polling about this topic before the Nov. 8 election. The way the questions were framed varies from poll to poll, so it's difficult to compare the figures directly. But generally they illustrate that Americans think Trump's tax returns are a serious issue.",

      "We wanted to know if the meme was accurate about how these three senators responded to the Sept. 11, 2012, attack by Islamic extremists on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, and whether the lawmakers are indeed trying to roll back embassy security.",
      "Many Republicans used the attack to criticize Hillary Clinton, secretary of state at the time, for being insufficiently attentive to embassy security and thus being at least partially at fault for the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens.",
      "How accurate is this assertion? Actually, it's misleading on several points. (We were unable to reach the group that created the meme, the Other 98, a group that says it fights \"economic injustice, undue corporate influence and threats to democracy.\")",
      "On the first point, Cruz and Rubio have levied strong opinions about Benghazi and Clinton for years, but it's a stretch to put Heller in the same category.",
      "To cite just one example, Cruz in June 2016 responded to the release of the final report of the House Select Committee on Benghazi by issuing a statement that called it \"disturbing\" that the \"bureaucratic incompetence of the Department of State under Secretary Clinton contributed to the administration's willful blindness, as the pleas for help from our foreign service officers in Libya were routinely ignored.\"",
      "Rubio, who like Cruz ran for president in 2016, also cast Benghazi as a shadow over Clinton's record. For instance, during a GOP primary debate in October 2015, Rubio said that Clinton \"got exposed as a liar\" during her day-long testimony before the Benghazi committee. (The Washington Post Fact Checker gave this Two Pinocchios out of a maximum of four.)",
      "And Rubio released a statement that rapped Clinton for the \"extraordinary failure\" by State Department officials, including Clinton, \"to grasp the security risks in Libya and Benghazi in particular, and take the appropriate action to protect Americans stationed in that country.\"",
      "Heller, however, has been much more circumspect about Benghazi. We found less rhetoric about Benghazi by Heller than by either Cruz or Rubio in our searches of Google, Lexis-Nexis and their respective Senate websites.",
      "For instance, Heller issued a statement calling for \"thoughts and prayers\" for the victims the day after the attacks took place, and another one two days later specifically memorializing one of the victims, Tyrone Woods, who was a Nevada resident. Those are the only two releases related to Benghazi on his Senate website. The only other examples linking Heller and Benghazi that came up in Nexis or Google searches occurred after the recent bill's introduction.",
      "Meanwhile, the meme's argument that the senators are hypocrites for wanting to cut embassy security by 50 percent is exaggerated.",
      "The bill at issue is S. 11, the Jerusalem Embassy and Recognition Act, which Cruz, Rubio and Heller laid out in a joint news release.",
      "The main focus of S. 11 is on moving the American embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem -- something that Congress mandated in 1995 when it passed the Jerusalem Embassy and Relocation Act. Presidents of both parties have declined to carry out the move, expressing concerns that doing so would complicate the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. President-elect Donald Trump is seen as more supportive of an embassy move.",
      "The part about the 50-percent cut for embassy security isn't made up.",
      "The bill says that if the embassy is not moved, then \"not more than 50 percent of the amounts appropriated to the Department of State for fiscal year 2017 under the heading Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance' may be obligated until the Secretary of State determines and reports to Congress that the United States Embassy in Jerusalem has officially opened.\" The bill has not yet been taken up.",
      "So saying that the senators \"introduced a bill to reduce embassy security by 50 percent\" is misleading. The senators introduced a bill to move the embassy, using the specter of a budget cut as leverage to support that goal -- not as the goal itself. None of them affirmatively wants to cut embassy security funding, though they are willing to risk that outcome if their primary goal is not met.",
      "In the Jan. 3 news release announcing the bill, the three senators didn't even mention the threat of a security cut, while repeatedly highlighting their goal of moving the embassy.",
      "In addition, Heller's office told PolitiFact that a different State Department account than the one mentioned in the bill -- the Diplomatic and Consular Programs account -- is a \"critical source\" of funds for \"high threat protection needs, security technology, armored vehicles, cyber security, and diplomatic couriers.\" And that account would not be touched by the threatened cuts.",
      "Finally, it's worth noting that this is the fourth time Heller has introduced a bill along these lines -- S.1622, introduced on Sept, 23, 2011; S.604, introduced on March 19, 2013; S.117, introduced on Jan. 7, 2015; and the current bill.",
      "So one could just as easily view the bill's introduction as the latest in a series of nearly identical bills that Heller has introduced like clockwork since 2011 -- almost a year before the Benghazi attacks took place.",
      "Our ruling",
      "A meme from the Other 98 said, \"The same 3 senators who have spent the last 3 years s------- themselves over Benghazi!' just introduced a bill to reduce embassy security by 50 percent.\"",
      "The meme has a point Cruz, Rubio and Heller did submit a bill that seeks to leverage the threat of a 50 percent cut to the State Department's \"Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance\" account in the service of forcing the executive branch to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.",
      "However, the meme goes too far in suggesting that the 50 percent cut was the purpose of the bill, and it ignores that some of the most important security funds would be untouched. The meme also ignores that essentially the same bill was introduced almost a year before the Benghazi attacks, and it incorrectly labels Heller as one of the more outspoken Republican lawmakers on Benghazi. We rate the statement Mostly False."

It also listed dollar amounts the senators were said to have received from \"big pharma.\"",

However, we were able to make pretty solid guesses about the underlying reference.",
      "It lines up with the voting results for an amendment voted on by the Senate on Jan. 11, 2017. The amendment is filled with legislative jargon, but it would basically create a mechanism to promote \"lower prescription drug prices for Americans by importing drugs from Canada.\"",
      "The measure failed, with 46 votes in favor and 52 against. The 13 Democratic senators targeted in the post were among those 52 votes against.",

      "It's important to know that every one of the 13 senators listed in the meme voted in favor of a separate amendment that did urge lower drug prices.",
      "This other amendment effectively prevented the Senate from considering legislation that did not \"as promised by (President-elect Donald Trump), lower drug prices, as certified by the Congressional Budget Office.\"",
      "Like the other amendment, this did not pass -- it won only 47 votes in favor, with 51 against. But the fact that all 13 senators listed on the meme voted to support this amendment muddies the conclusion of the meme that they all \"voted against cheaper medicines.\"",

      "Booker: \"I support the importation of prescription drugs as a key part of a strategy to help control the skyrocketing cost of medications. Any plan to allow the importation of prescription medications should also include consumer protections that ensure foreign drugs meet American safety standards. I opposed an amendment put forward last night that didn't meet this test.\"",
      "Coons: The amendment \"didn't meet the safety standards he believes are necessary,\" a spokesman Sean Coit told PolitiFact.",
      "Donnelly: \"I do not believe the best way to address the problem of rising prescription drug prices or to advance an importation policy is through legislation that is designed specifically to take health care away from the people who need it\" -- that is, the Republican-backed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.",
      "Casey: \"Sen. Casey had concerns about whether existing safety standards would apply to wholesalers,\" spokesman John Rizzo told PolitiFact. \"Sen. Casey has spoken with (Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., an amendment sponsor) about this, and the two of them are actively working on legislation that will allow importation.\"",
      "The numbers shown don't only represent money from 'big pharma'",
      "The assertion that these senators took millions from \"big pharma since 2011\" is also imprecise.",
      "We'll start with what looks like a typo. The dollar amounts shown are generally accurate for the 2016 campaign cycle, but if you were to include the totals going all the way back to 2011, as the meme states, then the amount would be substantially larger than what is shown. Because the point would have been stronger with larger dollar figures, this looks to us like an unintended mistake.",
      "However, the \"pharmaceuticals/health products\" category as defined by the Center for Responsive Politics is actually broader than what most reasonable people would consider \"big pharma.\"",
      "For this purpose, a more accurate subcategory for \"big pharma\" would be the Center for Responsive Politics category \"pharmaceutical manufacturing.\" Several of the senators listed on the post rank in the group's top 20 recipients of \"pharmaceutical manufacturing money\" during recent election cycles, but not all of them do -- and the amounts for each are smaller than what the meme reflects.",
      "Murray made the top 20 list in 2014 and 2016, for a cumulative $265,406. (You can investigate the numbers at the Center for Responsive Politics site here.) Coons made it in 2012 and 2014 for a cumulative $138,450. Casey made the list in 2012 and 2016, for a combined $231,380. Carper made the list in 2012 and 2016, for a combined $171,300. Menendez and Tester made the top 20 in 2012 ($153,800 and $54,750, respectively), Booker and Warner made it in 2014 ($233,750 and $71,050), and Bennet made it in 2016 ($135,127).",
      "These dollar amounts, which are admittedly incomplete, are lower than what the post shows for each senator's \"big pharma\" contributions.",
      "Then there's another caveat we always mention in articles like this one. The industry donation breakdowns tallied by the Center for Responsive Politics doesn't just include donations by fat-cat executives and company political action committees. It also includes donations made by any individual employed by a company in a given industry sector. This can include rank-and-file employees -- and in states with a heavy pharmaceutical presence in the workforce, this can be a significant factor. These states include Delaware, represented by Carper and Coons, and New Jersey, represented by Booker and Menendez.",

In reality, all 13 senators voted in favor of a different amendment that specifically advocated \"lower drug prices.\" In addition, the dollar amounts listed for the senators use an overly broad definition of \"big pharma,\" inflating the amount of money they have taken from the industry.",

      "At the first press briefing of the new administration, White House press secretary Sean Spicer blasted the media, saying they deliberately misled the public about the size of President Donald Trump's inauguration crowd.",
      "\"Photographs of the inaugural proceedings were intentionally framed in a way, in one particular Tweet, to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall,\" Spicer said on Jan. 21. \"That was the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period. Both in person and around the globe.\"",
      "Spicer offered a few \"facts\" to disprove media reports of low turnout, but many of them are misleading or inaccurate. His overall assertion that Trump's inaugural drew the \"largest audience\" ever is flat-out wrong.",
      "Infrastructure issues",
      "Spicer pointed to changes in infrastructure that gave the illusion of low turnout.",
      "It was the \"first time\" that floor coverings were used to protect the grass on the National Mall, which had highlighted empty spots in the inaugural crowd, an effect not experienced in past inaugurations, he said.",
      "But this is not the case. Floor coverings were also used in 2013, and floor coverings remained on the Mall during the Women's March on Washington the day after the inauguration.",
      "Spicer also blamed the \"first time\" usage of fencing and magnetometers on the Mall for \"preventing hundreds of thousands of people being able to access the Mall as quickly as they had inaugurations past.\"",
      "According to a 2017 Congressional Research Service report, screening magnetometers, or metal detectors, have been used in past inaugurations, though it's not clear if they were placed on the Mall itself. The screening zones, according to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, did include two busy metro stops close to the Mall.",
      "Spicer's claim was also disputed by New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt, who tweeted that two unnamed law enforcement officials told him \"magnetometers were not used in the areas Spicer said they were on the Mall.\"",
      "Crowd size",
      "Spicer then knocked the press for tweeting out \"inaccurate numbers involving crowd size.\"",
      "\"No one had numbers because the National Park Service, which controls the National Mall, does not put any out,\" he said. \"We do know a few things. So let's go through the facts.\"",
      "\"We know that from the platform from where the President was sworn in to 4th Street holds about 250,000 people. From 4th Street to the media tent is about another 220,000. And from the media tent to the Washington Monument another 250,000 people. All of this space was full when the President took the oath of office.\"",
      "Many news organizations, including PolitiFact, have noted that it's difficult to gauge crowd size and that estimates are inconsistent. The National Park Service stopped tallying crowds on the National Mall in 1995 after a dispute over the attendance of the Million Man March.",
      "Spicer's claim of full spaces on the Mall -- which photographs contradict -- would give Trump a crowd size of at least 720,000, which is higher than preliminary estimates reported in the media but are on par with the 700,000 to 900,000 organizers expected to attend. The President himself touted 1.5 million on Jan. 21 at CIA headquarters. But that still wouldn't have been the top figure.",

      "On the same day as he announced a halt on entries from Syria and six other predominantly Muslim countries, President Donald Trump claimed the United States was discriminating against Christians in its refugee admission policy.",
      "Trump's executive order declaring the ban includes an exemption for persecuted religious minorities.",
      "In an interview with the Christian Broadcast Network, Trump explained: \"If you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very, very tough to get into the United States. If you were a Muslim, you could come in, if you were a Christian, it was impossible.\"",
      "This is a claim we heard from Trump during the 2016 election, and it's inaccurate. Christians make up a very small fraction of Syrians admitted under the refugee program, but they have been able to enter the United States. There is no evidence that this is an outcome of discriminatory policy. Refugee admissions skew in favor of Christians in other countries.",
      "Admissions numbers",
      "From Jan. 1, 2012 (the year the first Syrian refugees began arriving) to Jan. 29, 2017, the United States admitted 19,324 refugees from Syria.",
      "According to federal data, this included 19,025 Muslims and 199 Christians. (Another 86 belonged to other religions or no religion at all.)",
      "So, right off the bat, Trump is wrong that it was \"impossible\" to enter the United States as a Christian.",
      "Christians do make up a small fraction of refugee admissions compared with their makeup in the overall population of Syria. (We'll explain why that may be later.) But they did come in; it was not \"impossible,\" as Trump said.",
      "Muslims made up about 98 percent of Syrian refugees, compared with about 87 percent of Syria's population, as of Jan. 12, 2017, according to the CIA World Factbook. Christians, meanwhile, were 10 percent of the population but just 1 percent of refugees. (The Pew Research Center meanwhile says about 5 percent of Syrians are Christians.)",
      "This pattern, however, doesn't exist for the other countries targeted by Trump's ban. In some cases, the reverse is true: The proportion of Christian refugee admissions are greater than the proportion of Christians living the country.",

      "When we looked into Trump's claim in July 2015, all the experts we spoke with said Trump's accusation is off base. A year and half later, there's still no evidence that Christians have a higher bar to clear for entry.",
      "David Martin, an immigration law expert at the University of Virginia who previously held posts at the Departments of State, Justice and Homeland Security, acknowledged that Christian Syrians make up a smaller number of admissions than they do the overall population.",
      "But he said, \"there are many possible explanations and this certainly doesn't reflect a general hostility to Christians.\"",
      "One possible explanation for the few number of Christian Syrians admitted, the Washington Post's Fact-Checker reported, is an initial religious disparity at the United Nations' refugee programs. (The long vetting process for refugees seeking entry to the United States begins with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee.)",
      "The UNHCR reports that 1.5 percent of the nearly 5 million Syrian refugees it has registered are Christian. Agency spokespeople have warned against speculation but suggested this may be because Syrian Christians have the means to move without seeking assistance from the United Nations.",
      "In October 2015, then-U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and current U.N. Secretary General Ant nio Guterres offered a few other theories.",
      "Christians in Syria \"have been less systematically victimized than they were in Iraq,\" he said. \"Most of the Syrian Christians have moved to Lebanon. And in Lebanon, the first thing that happened to me when I met with the Lebanese president ... when I asked him to start a resettlement program from Lebanon, (he said), don't resettle Christians because they are vital for us.\"",
      "Ann Richard, then-assistant secretary of state for population refugees and migration, suggested in a congressional hearing in December 2015 that Christian Syrians aren't looking to move out of the country.",
      "\"A disproportionate number of Syrians staying in the country are Christian. Now why is this? It's because a higher percentage of them support Assad and feel safer with him there,\" she said (around 2:23:50 mark).",
      "Regardless of the disparity in Syria, experts did not agree with Trump's suggestion that Christians face additional hurdles.",
      "\"The U.S. government does not discriminate on the basis of religion in refugee admission or resettlement, and if you look at refugee admissions by religion over the past 10 years, rather than just at the Syrian refugees in the past few years, there are likely more Christians than Muslims,\" Karen Jacobsen, a professor at Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy, told us previously.",
      "Martin pointed out that since 2004, Christians have made up about 46 percent of refugee admissions from Iraq. That's disportionate to the country's total Christian population by a factor of about 58.",
      "Geoffrey Mock, a Middle East specialist for Amnesty International USA, said Amnesty has documented a myriad of human rights violations in the refugee resettlement process, but not religious discrimination \"because we haven't see any of it from the U.S. side.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said, \"If you were a Muslim, you could come in, if you were a Christian, it was impossible.\"",
      "Hundreds of Syrian Christians have entered the United States through the refugee admissions program. Thousands more Christians from other countries targeted by Trump's ban have also entered.",

      "President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily suspending the admission into the United States of people from seven Muslim-majority countries and indefinitely banning refugees from war-torn Syria stirred an uproar across the nation, with protesters gathering at the nation's largest airports.",
      "Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a CNN interview from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport that it was important to protect the United States from people who want to harm the country. But he argued that refugees are heavily vetted by the U.S. government and that recent attacks have not been from nationals of the countries singled out by Trump.",
      "\"The various people who have, in fact, committed terrorist acts in this country, from 9/11 on, none of them came from any of the seven countries that are the subject of the president's executive order,\" Nadler said in a CNN interview Jan. 28. \"If you really want to protect this country, why are Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey left out of the order? Most of the 9/11 conspirators came from Saudi Arabia.\"",
      "Trump's executive order signed Jan. 27, called \"Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States,\" suspended for 90 days the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry of people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.",
      "Individuals from those seven countries who are U.S. lawful permanent residents are also stopped from re-entering the country (though exemptions may apply), the New York Times reported, attributing the information to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "We wondered if Nadler was correct by saying that since 9/11, terrorist acts in the United States have not been carried out by people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.",
      "Experts told us no fatal attack has been attributed to nationals from those countries, but that there have been a few non-deadly acts by individuals from two of those countries.",
      "Increased homegrown terrorism",
      "According to New America, a think tank compiling information on terrorist activities in the United States since 9/11, 94 people have been killed by jihadists in the past 15 years.",
      "But in its overview of who are the individuals committing the attacks, New America says the majority of attackers come from within.",
      "\"Far from being foreign infiltrators, the large majority of jihadist terrorists in the United States have been American citizens or legal residents. Moreover, while a range of citizenship statuses are represented, every jihadist who conducted a lethal attack inside the United States since 9/11 was a citizen or legal resident,\" the New America study says. \"In addition about a quarter of the extremists are converts, further confirming that the challenge cannot be reduced to one of immigration.\"",
      "\"It's certainly the case that none of the major, deadly attacks carried out in the United States were carried out by people from these countries,\" said Erin Miller, who manages the Global Terrorism Database for the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland.",
      "Other experts agreed.",
      "\"Since 9/11, no one has been killed in this country in a terrorist attack by anyone who emigrated from any of the seven countries,\" added William C. Banks, director of the Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism at Syracuse University College of Law.",
      "In June 2016, Omar Mateen, born in the United States to Afghan parents, killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in an Orlando nightclub shooting. In December 2015, a Pakistani woman, Tashfeen Malik, and her husband killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. The husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was born in the United States to Pakistani parents.",
      "However, there have been at least three non-deadly attacks in which the perpetrators were from Iran or Somalia, said John Mueller, a political scientist at Ohio State University, expert on terrorism and a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute.",
      "One of those examples includes the November 2016 attack at Ohio State University by a Somali refugee who had lived in Pakistan before coming to the United States. Abdul Razak Ali Artan, 18, was shot dead by a police officer after he slammed his car into pedestrians and injured others with a butcher knife. The FBI said it would investigate the attack as a \"potential act of terrorism.\"",
      "In September 2016, Dahir Adan was shot dead after stabbing nine people in a Minnesota shopping mall. Adan was identified by his father as Somali but born in Kenya, moving to the United States when he was a child.",
      "Another incident was in 2006, when Mohammed Reza Taheri-Azar ran a Jeep Cherokee into a crowd of people at his alma mater, the University of North Carolina. Thinking he would be killed during the attack, Taheri-Azar left a letter in his apartment saying he wanted revenge for the deaths of Muslims across the world caused by the United States, the AP reported. A naturalized citizen born in Iran, Taheri-Azar in 2008 plead guilty to nine counts of attempted first-degree murder and was sentenced for up to 33 years in prison.",
      "On ABC's This Week, Trump's press secretary, Sean Spicer, said the president's order covered countries that the Obama administration had identified as needing further travel restrictions.",

      "Starting in early 2016, individuals from countries that participate in the visa waiver program (that is, people allowed to travel to the United States without a visa) and who had also been in Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Yemen, Libya or Somalia recently (with exceptions for diplomatic or military purposes) were no longer permitted to come to the United States without a visa.

      "After a weekend of nationwide demonstrations in protest of immigration restrictions on entry from seven nations, President Donald Trump blamed the media for misreporting his controversial executive order and said it was an extension of former President Barack Obama's policies.",
      "\"My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror,\" Trump wrote in a Jan. 29 statement. \"To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting.\"",
      "To refresh, Trump issued an executive order on Jan. 27 barring citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Libya from entering the United States for 90 days. It also puts Syrian refugee admissions on hold indefinitely. (We go over some of the key issues in this explainer.)",
      "In 2011, Obama's state department stopped processing Iraqi refugee requests for six months, though it didn't disclose the policy like Trump did, ABC reported in 2013.",
      "So, are the policies similar as Trump claimed?",
      "In the most superficial of ways, yes. They both limit immigration into the United States on a temporary basis. But there are two significant differences that Trump omits.",
      "In 2011, there was a specific threat",
      "First, Obama's suspension was in direct response to a failed plot by Iraqi nationals living in Bowling Green, Ky., to send money, explosives and weapons to al-Qaida. The two men were arrested by the FBI in May 2011 for actions committed in Iraq and trying to assist overseas terrorist groups.",
      "Both had entered the United States as refugees after lying about their past terrorism ties on paperwork. One man worked as a bombmaker in Iraq, and the FBI even matched his fingerprints to an unexploded IED discovered in 2005 in Iraq, raising questions about the thoroughness of the vetting process.",
      "Trump's ban, meanwhile, is more preemptive. As PolitiFact reported, no refugee or immigrant from any of the seven countries targeted by the ban has been implicated in any fatal terrorist attack in the United States, though perpetrators of at least three non-deadly cases were connected to Iran or Somalia.",
      "Obama's order was narrower in scope",
      "Second, the scope of the two policies is slightly different. Obama's 2011 order put a pause on refugee processing, whereas Trump's halt in entries applies to all non-U.S. visitors.",
      "It should also be noted that Iraqi refugees were still admitted to the United States every month in 2011, though there was a significant drop after May of that year. Here's a chart with data from the state department:",
      "According to the New York Times, the Obama administration also required new background checks for visa applicants from Iraq after the Bowling Green incident. Lawmakers at a 2012 congressional hearing also indicated that the Department of Homeland Security expanded screening to the Iraqi refugees already settled in the United States.",
      "But again, these are different from a blanket ban on visitors. Obama, speaking through a spokesperson, disagreed with the comparison in a statement.",
      "There are other precedents for temporary halts in immigration. A 2016 Congressional Research Service report notes that refugee admissions were also briefly suspended after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack to review the security procedures, leading to an overhaul of the system. A special subset of refugee admissions for reuniting families was suspended in 2008 in certain locations in Africa after higher rates of fraud.",
      "So like Obama's 2011 suspension, both the post-9/11 and African cases were in reaction to immediate issues and limited to refugees.",
      "Trump's order is broader, and his administration has provided no evidence it is in response to any particular event.",
      "The seven countries on Trump's list",
      "While not necessarily part of this fact-check, Trump's suggestion that he selected the seven countries as a continuation of Obama's policy is imprecise.",
      "According to the executive order, Trump's action applies to \"countries designated pursuant to Division O, Title II, Section 203 of the 2016 consolidated Appropriations Act.\"",
      "That refers to a 2015 act, signed into law by Obama, revising the United States' visa waiver program. The visa waiver program allows citizens from 38 countries to enter the United States without a visa for up to 90 days. Under the legislation, citizens of those 38 countries who had traveled to Iraq, Syria, Iran, and Sudan after March 2011 were no longer eligible for the visa waiver. Libya, Yemen, and Somalia were later added to the list.",
      "In other words, Obama's actions dealt with people who had visited Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen, not citizens of those countries, and it did not prohibit them from entering the United States.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said, \"My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months.\"",
      "The Obama administration in 2011 delayed processing Iraqi refugees for six months following evidence of a failed plot by two Iraqi refugees.",
      "Trump's executive order temporarily bars travel to the United States for all citizens from seven countries, and it is not in direct response to actions from citizens of those countries.",
      "Furthermore, Iraqi refugees were nonetheless admitted to the United States during the 2011 suspension while Trump has put an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees.",

      "\"Now, the thing I have to mention is that Barack Obama, when he was president, found out about this, in terms of if it were Russia, found out about it in August,\" Trump said during a July 6 press conference in Poland. \"Now, the election was in November. That's a lot of time. He did nothing about it.\"",
      "People can argue that the Obama administration didn't do enough to immediately crack down on Russia for meddling in the election. But Trump's statement that Obama \"did nothing\" in the months leading up to Nov. 8 goes too far.",
      "The Obama administration learned in summer 2016 that election-related hacks could be traced back to the Russian government.",
      "Soon after, at the September G20 Summit in China, Obama personally confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin and told him to back off.",
      "Then-CIA Director John Brennan gave a similar warning to his Russian counterpart, Federal Security Bureau Director Alexander Bortnikov, during an August phone call.",
      "On Oct. 7, the Obama administration publicly identified Russia for the first time as being behind election-related hacks, issuing a joint statement from Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "In the days following that statement, Press Secretary Josh Earnest and Vice President Joe Biden said the administration was considering options for a \"proportional\" response.",
      "Also, throughout August and up through the election, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson encouraged state-level election officials, through official statements and phone calls, to protect voting-related systems from cyber intrusions.",
      "However, the Obama administration took its most significant actions against Russia after Nov. 8. In late December, Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats and suspected intelligence agents to leave the United States, and he also imposed narrow sanctions on some Russian individuals and organizations.",
      "\"While I don't think it's fair to say that the administration did nothing,' their actions were fairly minimal prior to Nov 8,\" said Emma Ashford, an international security expert at the libertarian Cato Institute.",
      "Ashford and a couple other experts in U.S.-Russia relations told us that the Obama administration felt like it had few options prior to the election because of the political climate.",
      "The Obama administration likely waited until after the election to take any truly punitive measures because they \"wanted to avoid the appearance of interfering in the election, and because they felt it was probably up to the next administration to deal with this policy problem,\" Ashford said.",
      "The White House had to consider the fact that acknowledging Russia's involvement could actually help Russia get closer to its goal of delegitimizing the election, said Yoshiko Herrera, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. And there was also the possibility that retaliating could provoke Russia to take more action against the United States in a variety of arenas, including Syria.",
      "Herrera added that it's quite possible the Obama administration and intelligence community took additional action against Russia that the public doesn't know about because it's classified.",
      "In hindsight, knowing how the Russia storyline has played out over the past few months, \"it might have been better to call out Russia for hacking a bit sooner, but at the time I think the Obama administration tried to be responsible,\" she said.",
      "Trump said that Obama found out about Russia \"in August. Now, the election was in November. That's a lot of time. He did nothing about it.\"",
      "The Obama administration did not sit idle while Russia interfered in the election, as Trump makes it seem. The administration publicly named the Russian government as the culprit, confronted Putin in person, and worked to secure the country's election infrastructure all while the intelligence agencies investigated the issue.",
      "That said, Obama waited until December, after the election, to take any public, punitive measures against Putin, when he kicked out diplomats and imposed sanctions.",
      "Trump's statement contains a grain of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False."

      "Trump claimed that Podesta denied handing over a DNC server to intelligence agencies, but Podesta never chaired the DNC, nor had any involvement in the DNC's handling of their email server, according to DNC spokesperson Adrienne Watson.",
      "\"I had nothing to do with the Democratic National Committee I chaired Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign,\" Podesta wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Post. \"So there was no DNC server for me to refuse to give, and I was never asked for one.\"",
      "The op-ed followed a seven-tweet backlash at Trump's statement, where Podesta denied the claim and told Trump \"the Russians committed a crime when they stole my emails to help get you elected President.\"",
      "7/7 Dude, get your head in the game. You're representing the US at the G20.",
      "Podesta was, however, a victim of the same phishing trick as the DNC, led by group of hackers that the Homeland Security Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence linked to the Russian government.",

      "\"The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,\" the statement added.",
      "Setting aside Podesta's role, Trump is returning to an old talking point questioning the DNC's cooperation with the intelligence community. In March 5, Trump tweeted:",
      "\"Is it true the DNC would not allow the FBI access to check server or other equipment after learning it was hacked? Can that be possible?\"",

      "In his testimony in January on the cyber attacks, then-director of the FBI James Comey said the agency never got access to the machines themselves, but obtained access to the forensics from a review of the system performed by CrowdStrike, a third-party cybersecurity firm.",
      "\"We got the forensics from the pros that they hired which -- again, best practice is always to get access to the machines themselves, but this my folks tell me was an appropriate substitute,\" Comey said.",
      "\"The DNC coordinated with the FBI and federal intelligence agencies and provided everything they requested, including copies of DNC servers,\" Watson said. She added that the copy contains the same information as the physical server.",
      "The FBI joined CrowdStrike's efforts to boot Russia from the server, but then-Homeland Security Department secretary Jeh Johnson complained the DNC rebuffed their offer to help. This was because Russia was already out of their system by then.",
      "Trump's mentioning the CIA's involvement came as a surprise to both Podesta and the DNC.",
      "\"The CIA has no role in domestic intelligence-gathering in fact, it's prohibited,\" Podesta wrote in his op-ed. \"The CIA would never ask anyone at the DNC for a server. Whether the FBI asked the DNC for access to a server, I don't know, beyond what I've read.\"",

      "Responding to compliments about his election victory and support from evangelical voters, President Donald Trump told Christian Broadcasting Network's founder Pat Robertson that he had signed an order to empower religious leaders to speak up politically.",
      "\"We've really helped because I've gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment, now we are going to go try to get rid of it permanently in Congress, but I signed an executive order so that now people like you that I want to hear from, ministers and and preachers and rabbis and whoever it may be, they can speak,\" Trump said in a July 12 interview with Robertson. \"You know, you couldn't speak politically before; now you can. And I want to hear from you and others that we like.\"",
      "During the campaign Trump accurately said that an amendment pushed by Lyndon B. Johnson threatened religious institutions with the loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocated their political views. Trump then said he would repeal that language.",
      "So Trump's comments to Robertson left us wondering if in fact Trump had \"gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment\" and if because of his executive order religious leaders were able to speak up politically.",
      "Politics and religion experts told us Trump's remarks were misleading on several grounds: He does not have the constitutional authority to eliminate the law, and religious leaders have been speaking up politically even before Trump's order, despite the legal restriction.",
      "We noted in a previous fact check of Trump's remarks about the \"Johnson Amendment\" that the restriction comes from the Internal Revenue Code, and that it applies to all 501(c)(3) organizations, known as charitable organizations.",
      "The term \"Johnson Amendment\" derives from America's 36th president, Lyndon B. Johnson, who became president when John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Johnson championed the restriction in 1954 when he was a U.S. senator running for re-election. A conservative nonprofit group that wanted to limit the treaty-making ability of the president produced material that called for electing his primary opponent, millionaire rancher-oilman Dudley Dougherty.",
      "In response, Johnson, then Senate Democratic minority leader, introduced an amendment to section 501(c)(3) of the federal tax code dealing with tax-exempt charitable organizations, including groups organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literacy and educational purposes, or to prevent cruelty to children or animals. The objective was to restrict the involvement in partisan politics of organizations that wanted to be exempt from paying taxes.",
      "The law says: \"Under the Internal Revenue Code, all section 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office. Contributions to political campaign funds or public statements of position (verbal or written) made on behalf of the organization in favor of or in opposition to any candidate for public office clearly violate the prohibition against political campaign activity. Violating this prohibition may result in denial or revocation of tax-exempt status and the imposition of certain excise taxes.\"",
      "Trump told Robertson that he had \"gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment.\"",
      "But that's misleading. Trump cannot get \"rid of\" a law because a president does not have that constitutional authority. Trump needs Congress to take action; he even referenced that process when he added to his statement, \"now we are going to go try to get rid of it permanently in Congress.\" (A bill on this topic introduced by Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., is in the Ways and Means Committee.)",
      "We asked the White House for more information on Trump's comments but did not get a response.",
      "What Trump has done is sign an executive order that tells the Treasury Department to be lenient in its enforcement of current law against religious organizations.",
      "Specifically, the May 4 order said:",
      "\"The Secretary of the Treasury shall ensure, to the extent permitted by law, that the Department of the Treasury does not take any adverse action against any individual, house of worship, or other religious organization on the basis that such individual or organization speaks or has spoken about moral or political issues from a religious perspective, where speech of similar character has, consistent with law, not ordinarily been treated as participation or intervention in a political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) a candidate for public office by the Department of the Treasury.\"",
      "The order defines adverse action as the imposition of any tax or tax penalty, delay or denial of tax-exempt status, disallowance of tax deductions for contributions made to the charitable organizations, \"or any other action that makes unavailable or denies any tax deduction, exemption, credit, or benefit.\"",
      "An array of experts and groups said Trump's order doesn't achieve much.",
      "\"As of right now, Trump's comments that he got rid of the Johnson amendment are inaccurate and an overstatement,\" said Jeanine Kraybill, who researches politics and religion and is an assistant professor of political science at California State University-Bakersfield.",
      "Trump did not get rid of the Johnson Amendment, \"he just ordered that apparently it not be enforced,\" said Kenneth D. Wald, a distinguished professor of political science at the University of Florida.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union expressed concerns about Trump's executive order based on a leaked draft, but later said it had \"no discernible policy outcome.\"",
      "The conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom, which advocates on behalf of pastors and churches and against the Johnson Amendment, said Trump's order came up short and described it as just \"vague instructions\" with wiggle room to be ignored.",
      "Experts also told us that it's inaccurate to suggest religious leaders could not speak politically.",
      "\"The regulations have never been designed to prevent ministers or other church officials from speaking in church about social and political issues,\" said Wald, the University of Florida professor. What they are forbidden from doing is formally endorsing candidates, Wald said.",
      "Also, the Johnson Amendment has not been strongly enforced over the years, and preachers and pastors have openly challenged it, said Kraybill, the professor at California State University-Bakersfield.",
      "Kraybill said that since 2008 the \"Pulpit Freedom Sunday\" movement, which began with the Alliance Defending Freedom, has led pastors of primarily conservative churches to intentionally preach about candidates and encourage their congregations to vote a certain way. A pastor in San Diego told CNN last year that his church records sermons and sends them to the Internal Revenue Service \"in the hopes of provoking a lawsuit,\" and that those efforts have been fruitless.",
      "\"It has been quite rare as matter of practice for the IRS to enforce that rule,\" said Kent Greenfield, a law professor at Boston College.",
      "Pew Research Center in August 2016 published survey results that said about two-thirds of Americans who had attended religious services had heard clergy at their church speak about social and political issues. Some churchgoers had even heard clergy speak in support or opposition of a specific presidential candidate, Pew found.",
      "With that context, Trump's executive order in many ways attempts to codify the status quo. But it doesn't eliminate the Johnson Amendment.",
      "Trump said, \"I've gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment I signed an executive order so that now ... ministers and and preachers and rabbis and whoever it may be, they can speak. You know, you couldn't speak politically before, now you can.\"",
      "Experts say Trump's claim is an overstatement because his executive order merely directed the Treasury Department to be lenient in its enforcement of the law.

In practice, the law has rarely been enforced, experts said, and clergy members have spoken about social and political issues, or even spoken in favor or against candidates.",

      "Vice President Mike Pence says that when it comes to deregulation, President Donald Trump's record is historic.",
      "Trump \"has signed more laws cutting through federal red tape than any president in American history and has already saved businesses and families up to $18 billion in red tape costs every year,\" Pence said in a speech at the National Retail Federation's Annual Retail Advocates Summit on July 18, 2017.",
      "Looking at the first half of the statement, we wondered, has Trump surpassed his predecessors in deregulation? And, is the savings $18 billion?",
      "It's not so easy to quantify laws that cut red tape. Experts we spoke with said that other presidents have cut through more red tape than Trump so far, citing the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, as well as President Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan's deregulation of such previously heavily regulated industries as air travel, trucking, banking and telecommunications.",
      "However, many of these measures were taken through federal agencies, or constituted a single law, whereas Pence cited a record number of laws passed.",
      "\" Laws cutting red tape' is a sufficiently ambiguous phrase that it is nearly impossible to say who has cut the most,\" said Jon Schaff, a professor of political science at Northern University. \"If you were going to judge Pence's claim, you'd have to go through all laws for all presidents and then decide whether each law was deregulatory in some manner and then how much did it deregulate. How does one judge such a thing? How much red tape' was saved through welfare reform in the 1990s? Or simply getting rid of federal controls on speed limits on highways? Or tax reform in 1986?\"",
      "When we asked Pence's office for clarification, spokesperson Marc Lotter said that Trump had signed 14 Congressional Review Act measures compared with one previously. He's right.",
      "President Bill Clinton signed the Congressional Review Act in 1994, and it allows lawmakers to overturn regulations by federal agencies within 60 legislative days of their issue dates. It mainly applies when a new administration is aligned with the new Congress, and both oppose a certain set of last-minute regulations from the previous president.",
      "Unlike executive authority -- which requires notice to the public and hearings, and produces outcomes that are often challenged in court -- Congressional Review Act measures only require an up-or-down majority vote in Congress.",
      "\"Pence's office is clearly, unambiguously correct when it comes to Trump signing 14 Congressional Review Act resolutions to just one for all previous presidents though do note that it is called the Congressional Review Act, and really it would be more fair to say that Congress initiated those actions, and Trump was in a position to ratify their choices,\" said Philip Wallach, a senior fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution.",
      "Has Trump already saved Americans $18 billion with his deregulatory measures?",
      "Lotter directed us to research by the right-leaning policy group American Action Forum to back up the talking point.",
      "The AAF calculated $1.1 billion in savings, using the Federal Register's estimated costs of regulations issued by the Obama administration that were repealed by Congressional Review Act measures.",
      "\"In addition, President Trump has formally delayed and signaled an intention to amend several other major rules. Combined, these actions could generate more than $18 billion in annual regulatory savings for businesses, investors, and consumers,\" the AAF said in the cited report. An updated AAF post places this estimate closer to $21.8 billion.",
      "We first parsed through the $1.1 billion saved by the historic CRA measures, which checks out with the Federal Register data. What doesn't check out is Pence's statement that these dollars have already been saved.",
      "The reason it was possible for Trump to roll back these rules was that they had been put in place at the end of the previous administration, which also means that many of them hadn't yet taken effect.",
      "Take the Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers, a rule that would require energy companies to report to the Federal Exchange Committee payments made to foreign governments. The AAF calculated its rollback would save $590.7 million annually, but those savings would only begin on Sept. 30, 2018, the rule's required compliance date. The rollback of the Stream Protection Rule, calculated to save $81 million annually, would only start in 2020.",
      "With compliance dates months or years in the future, businesses were unlikely to have sunk costs to comply with these rules according to Amit Narang, a regulatory policy advocate at Public Citizen, a left-leaning government watchdog group.",
      "The calculation of costs also ignores the benefits of these rules and industry innovation that may reduce the cost of compliance.",
      "In the Office of Management and Budget's last annual report computing the costs and benefits of the federal regulations that were produced between 2005 and 2015, they found that benefits outweighed costs.",
      "\"In 2014 dollars, aggregate annual benefits are estimated to be between $269 and $872 billion and costs between $74 and $110 billion,\" the report said. \"These ranges reflect uncertainty in the benefits and costs of each rule at the time that it was evaluated.\"",
      "We then went on to look at the larger chunk of costs the AAF analyzed to come up with total annual savings from executive actions (not just Congressional Act Review measures). These potential savings were calculated using the costs estimated by the Federal Register at the time the legislation was put in place.",
      "Taking these cost estimates as full savings assumes that the Trump administration will be able to fully annul rules that experts expect would take years to achieve.",
      "For example, the executive action to dismantle the Clean Power Act would theoretically save $8.4 billion annually, but it will take a years-long rulemaking process to complete. The executive order to roll back the Gainful Employment Rule, estimated to save $433 million annually, will be delayed due to a court challenge.",
      "The last chunk of the $21.8 billion estimate came from rule delays, which brings us back to our concern with saying the administration has saved the costs from future regulations cut by CRA measures. These costs weren't straining families and businesses to begin with, because they were not yet in effect, and have simply been pushed further back.",
      "The Office of Management and Budget's latest calculation of the Trump administration's annualized cost savings estimated these at $22 million, which is significantly lower than Pence's $18 billion figure. We repeatedly reached out to the OMB for more details on their projections but did not hear back.",
      "Pence said Trump \"has signed more laws cutting through federal red tape than any President in American history and has already saved businesses and families up to $18 billion in red tape costs every year.\"",
      "Whether Trump has signed more laws cutting red tape depends upon how you count legislation. Trump did sign a record number of laws rolling back regulations under the Congressional Review Act, but that's not the only way to count deregulatory action.",
      "Also, Pence is counting eggs before they hatch in using an $18 billion estimate of total savings. The deadlines for compliance for most of the measures he annulled had yet to go into effect, and the fate of many of the executive actions that would back past regulation remains unclear.",
      "We rate this statement Half True."

      "The White House says the media is hostile to the president and is using some new evidence presented by a conservative blogger to make its case.",
      "But that evidence is faulty.",
      "On Fox News on Saturday, Kellyanne Conway, one of President Donald Trump's top advisers, argued that the media blocks important White House messaging by covering issues the public sees as unimportant.",
      "\"This is a media that has decided it's going be very hostile,\" Conway told Fox News host Jeanine Pirro on July 22, 2017.",
      "Conway then cited two different bits of research to contrast the percentage of news coverage devoted to different political issues and the public's general interest in each issue.",
      "\"People were asked, which of the following issues is most important to you?\" Conway said. \"Health care, 35 percent (of people said it was the most important issue, but it) got like 10 percent of the coverage. Russia, 6 percent most important issue, received 75 percent of the coverage. Immigration, 10 percent most important issue, zero percent of the coverage.\"",
      "New White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made a similar claim on ABC's This Week.",
      "\"Look, there was a Wall Street Journal poll that came out this week that showed that the top three issues that Americans care about are immigration, health care, and jobs. The top three issues that the media cares about are Russia, Russia, and Russia,\" Huckabee Sanders said.",
      "\"There's 15 times more coverage on Russia than on the three big issues that Americans care about. That's a problem. That's exactly the definition of Russia fever.\"",
      "The poll Huckabee Sanders is talking about came from Bloomberg, not the Wall Street Journal, and it found that health, jobs and terrorism were the top three important issues among respondents (not immigration, health care and jobs).",
      "That said, we wondered more broadly if the White House's claim the media is devoting 75 percent of its coverage to the Russia investigation while few people claim it is the country's most important issue.",
      "Conway's claim stems from a post on the conservative blog Ricochet.com comparing a Bloomberg poll that asked Americans what they see as the most important issue facing the country right now to a June 27 Media Research Center survey of the time broadcast networks' evening newscasts devoted to different issues.",
      "Bloomberg's poll found that six percent of Americans said the United States' \"relationship with Russia\" is the most important issue facing the country right now, behind health care, immigration, jobs, terrorism and even climate change.",
      "The Media Research Center, a conservative group, tracked coverage on the network news broadcasts of ABC, CBS and NBC from May 17 to June 20.",
      "The Ricochet's Jon Gabriel put these two pieces of information together.",
      "He concluded that of 469 combined minutes of coverage of Trump during those broadcasts, 353 focused on either the firing of former FBI Director James Comey or Russia.",
      "Put another way, of the broadcasts it analyzed, the Media Research Center found 75 of coverage of Trump focused on questions about Comey or Trump.",
      "\"The media have shown how drastically out of step they are with their own audience. If they want to earn back their hemorrhaging Nielsen numbers, perhaps they can spend time on something other than Russia Russia Russia.\"",
      "Upon deeper analysis, however, the numbers don't hold up. And experts we spoke to raised serious flaws in comparing the two pieces of research.",
      "The Ricochet post misreads the Media Research Center analysis. The Ricochet post appears to use this Media Research Center graphic to count the number of minutes the evening news talked about Trump.",
      "",
      "Those categories total 469 minutes, 75 percent of which are about Russia/Comey stories. But the Media Research Center said that it found 640 minutes of total coverage of Trump in its analysis not 469 minutes. That means, excluding anything else, that airtime devoted to the Russia probe constituted 55 percent of all coverage of the Trump presidency during the five weeks following the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller.",
      "It's also worth making clear that the Media Research Center study was only analyzing coverage of Trump, not all media coverage.",
      "The Media Research Center analysis is limited. It is important to note that this study was only looking at network evening newscasts from ABC, CBS and NBC.",
      "It doesn't include Fox or Fox News, CNN, MSNBC or any other cable news channel. It also doesn't include newspapers or radio or online publications like Politico. On top of that, the analysis only covers about a month (May 17-June 20).",
      "\"A more extensive study would likely have somewhat different results of individual news outlets,\" said Stephen Farnsworth, director of University of Mary Washington's Center for Leadership and Media Studies. \"One of the things you see when you compare newspapers with television is a much wider range of topics being discussed, much more material than in a 30-minute news broadcast.\"",
      "Other polls show that Americans are interested in the Russia investigation. The question in the Bloomberg poll Conway referenced was not about the Russia investigation. Other polls suggest that Americans are interested in the investigation. A June poll by the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 48 percent of people surveyed said they were extremely or very concerned that Trump or others involved with his campaign had inappropriate contacts with the Russian government during last year's presidential campaign. Another 20 percent said they were moderately concerned.",
      "The White House and Trump play a role in setting what's covered. Experts told us that it's also worth noting that the media often covers what elected officials say or do. So if they're talking more about Russia, the media will, too.",
      "Farnsworth pointed to a dearth of committee hearings and public debate on recent Republican health care legislation and the newsworthiness of firing an FBI director.",
      "Albert May, Associate Emeritus Professor of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University, said Trump's tweets calling attention to the Russia probe has helped fuel more coverage. At the same time, Trump has kept a relatively quiet public schedule, May said.",
      "None of the experts we talked with were surprised by the schism between the public's policy concerns and the media's coverage of the issue.",
      "\"The longstanding criticism of the press is that you focus on the scandal and not the policy issue like health care, but the truth is that's what people are most interested in,\" May said.",
      "\"The media's issue agenda and the public's issue agenda are never a perfect match,\" said Thomas Patterson, a Bradlee Professor of Government and the Press at Harvard. \"Typically, the public ranks a scandal below policy issues when asked in a poll their opinion of the nation's most important problem.' So I think what we're seeing in the numbers is business as usual by the national press.\"",
      "Conway said just 6 percent of Americans say Russia is the country's most important issue, yet the story receives \"75 percent of the coverage\" in the media.",
      "A credible national poll found that six percent of Americans listed the U.S.-Russian relationship as the country's most important issue. The question did not include any discussion of investigating whether Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.",
      "At the same time, an analysis by a conservative research organization shows that network news on ABC, NBC and CBS have made the Russia story an integral part of their Trump coverage.",
      "But experts caution about reading too much into the network news analysis, which is limited in scope. And either way, Conway's numbers are off by 20 percentage points.",

There were four other months prior to Trump's presidency that matched today's rate, and it was slightly lower -- 4.3 percent -- a month earlier, during Trump's own presidency. Here's a chart.",

      "President Donald Trump took to Twitter to launch his latest salvo at Amazon, accusing the company of being a monopolistic tax cheat.",
      "\"Is Fake News Washington Post being used as a lobbyist weapon against Congress to keep Politicians from looking into Amazon no-tax monopoly?\" Trump tweeted.",
      "This is not the first time Trump has feuded with the online retail giant led by Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, which has published a number of news stories that have angered Trump.",
      "The president's description of Amazon struck us as questionable. So we decided to look into it.",
      "With more than $136 billion in sales last year, there's no doubt about Amazon's status as an online shopping empire.",
      "But Amazon is not a monopoly, said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert on antitrust law.",
      "A monopoly exists when a company so dominates a market that it can reduce output and cause a rise in prices over a substantial period of time. This level of market control is outlawed by antitrust statutes designed to promote competition for the benefit of consumers.",
      "\"We measure an antitrust violation by looking at consumer harm -- not harm to competitors,\" Hovenkamp said. \"Most complaints about Amazon come from competitors. By and large, Amazon is pretty good with customers, so you don't usually hear consumers squawking about this.\"",
      "Monopoly law typically kicks in when a company controls about 75 percent of a given market, Hovenkamp said. He noted that in 2000, Microsoft was deemed to be a monopoly because of its control of over 90 percent of the market for Windows-based computers.",
      "But no U.S. tribunal whether federal or state court, or the Federal Trade Commission has ever found Amazon to be a monopoly, Hovenkamp said.",
      "Trump is wrong to say Amazon is not subject to tax.",
      "Like other businesses, Amazon pays taxes on corporate income, property, payroll and unemployment insurance, said Joseph Henchman, the executive vice president of the business-backed Tax Foundation. Amazon has also recently changed its policy on state sales tax, he added.",
      "According to regulatory filings, Amazon paid a combined total of $412 million in federal, state, local and foreign taxes last year. In 2015 it paid $273 million in combined taxes, and $177 million the previous year.",
      "But Amazon has faced criticism for taking advantage of tax breaks and loopholes.",
      "Only 13 percent of Amazon's profits went to federal, state, local and foreign taxes from 2007 through 2015, according to an analysis by S&P Global Market Intelligence. For the sake of comparison, that's about half the average amount S&P 500 companies paid over the same period.",
      "Amazon's combined tax burden also falls well below the official U.S. corporate tax rate of 35 percent. In fact, one study found Amazon paid just a 9.3 percent effective federal income tax between 2008 and 2012.",
      "Nonetheless, Trump is wrong to say they've avoided tax collectors altogether.",
      "At the state level, Amazon, which launched online in 1995, long resisted charging a sales tax. But by 2012, it was collecting and paying sales tax in California, Texas and Pennsylvania, and elsewhere.",
      "Today, the company collects taxes in all states where state sales taxes exist, plus Washington, D.C. (all states except Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon collect sales tax). Henchman noted that taxes apply to all of Amazon's own sales, but not the large percentage of sales by other sellers using the Amazon platform.",
      "The digital retail giant's decision to collect state sales tax is mostly voluntary.",
      "That's because a 1992 Supreme Court ruling effectively restricts states from forcing online retailers to pay state and local sales taxes if the company has no brick-and-mortar property or employees in the state.",
      "The court's ruling left the door open for Congress to override its decision through legislation -- and Amazon has lobbied Congress to do so by passing the Marketplace Fairness Act, which would subject online retailers to state sales tax.",
      "\"We support a federal law that would allow states to require sales tax collection by remote sellers under a nationwide system,\" Amazon wrote in its 2016 regulatory filing.",
      "Currently, Amazon does not have physical buildings or employ workers in all the states where it charges taxes, though its footprint has grown in recent years and may grow larger still if its plan to acquire Whole Foods comes to fruition.",
      "Trump said Amazon has a \"no-tax monopoly.\"",
      "Amazon is an industry giant, but it does not exert enough market control to be considered a monopoly, and no U.S. tribunal has ever deemed it as such.",
      "While Amazon takes advantage of tax breaks and loopholes, it pays federal corporate tax, and charges sales taxes in 46 U.S. jurisdictions. It also supports federal legislation that would require other online retailers to pay state tax on internet sales.",

      "We wondered how many service members identified as transgender, something the U.S. Defense Department didn't disclose to us. But a couple of estimates show that there are likely thousands of transgender soldiers, sailors and airmen.",

      "Transgender soldiers, airmen and sailors would have faced being medically discharged for disclosing that information, but Obama's policy allowed those service members to serve openly if they chose. His administration gave the military until July 1, 2017, to fully implement the rule.",
      "On June 30, Defense Secretary James Mattis delayed implementation by six months, before Trump appeared to revoke the rule entirely via Twitter.",
      "As many as 250 service members have asked to formally change their preferred genders, or have already been approved, the Associated Press has reported.",
      "The Defense Department would not elaborate on Trump's announcement, including how many transgender people served in the military. Reports have said the Pentagon does not keep track of transgender personnel.",
      "Instead they sent us to the military's transgender policy web page, which as of this writing had not yet been updated. A Defense Department spokesman said the policy would be revised \"in the near future,\" with White House input. A Trump spokesman did not answer our attempts to contact him.",
      "Lieu spokesman Jack d'Annabale said the congressman got his estimate from a May 2014 brief by researchers at UCLA's Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy.",
      "They used responses to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, sent to respondents by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the National Center for Transgender Equality. The definition of transgender included \"those whose gender identity or expression differs from those traditionally associated with their assigned sex at birth,\" according to the study.",
      "Extrapolating that 0.3 percent of the population identified as transgender, UCLA's researchers estimated that there were \"approximately 15,500 transgender individuals are serving on active duty or in the Guard or Reserve forces.\" It also said that about 134,400 transgender people were veterans or retired.",
      "Another study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2015 used data from the UCLA brief and other sources to determine that 12,800 service member would be eligible for transgender health care. The study suggested of those, 188 would use benefits for transition services, at a cost of $4.2 million to $5.6 million.",
      "More recently, the Pentagon commissioned a June 2016 RAND Corporation report studying the effects of integrating transgender service members. (CNN's Berman actually mentioned this one during Lieu's interview.)",
      "The think tank estimated that there were between 1,320 and 6,630 active duty transgender personnel, and between 830 and 4,160 in the reserves. The midrange estimates were for 2,450 active duty and 1,510 reserve duty service members.",
      "As a side note to Trump's concern over costs: Only a fraction of active duty transgender service members were likely to seek medical treatment, the study said, resulting in a high-end estimate of an $8.4 million increase in health care costs, or 0.13 percent.",
      "The RAND study used the National Transgender Discrimination Survey and other surveys, including private insurance data. RAND started with a lower population prevalence than UCLA did 0.19 percent instead of 0.3 percent accounting for the lower figure.",
      "If we combine the top RAND estimates for active duty and reserves, between 2,150 and 10,790 active duty and reserve service members may identify as transgender.",
      "Defense Department projections for the 2017 fiscal year were for 1.28 million active duty personnel and a little more than 800,000 in the reserves.",

One 2014 UCLA brief estimated as many as 15,500 active duty and reserve service members may identify as transgender. A 2016 RAND Corp. study commissioned by the Pentagon suggested between 2,150 and 10,790 active and reserve duty troops.",

      "Just days after President Donald Trump announced that he would be pulling the United States out of the Paris international climate agreement, his Environmental Protection Agency administrator went on the Sunday shows to defend Trump's decision.",
      "During the June 4 interview on NBC's Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd asked Scott Pruitt whether it was disingenuous for the administration to promise a rebirth of coal.",
      "On the one hand, coal is a high-carbon-emissions fuel that is at a disadvantage under the Paris agreement and could potentially benefit from the United States' exit from the accord. On the other, some experts have said that the demise of coal as an energy source has less to do with emissions than with lost market share to a competing fossil fuel -- natural gas -- and technological improvements that have bolstered renewable energies such as wind and solar.",
      "Here's how Pruitt answered Todd's suggestion that the administration was making a \"false promise.\"",
      "\"Dead wrong, because the numbers show exactly the opposite,\" Pruitt said. \"In fact, since the the fourth quarter of last year until most recently, we've added almost 50,000 jobs in the coal sector. In the month of May alone, almost 7,000 jobs.\"",
      "Is that correct? Calculating job figures for the coal industry is tricky, as we have previously noted, but we found reason to be skeptical of Pruitt's numbers.",
      "The EPA pointed us to a separate interview Pruitt had on ABC's This Week, when he said, \"We've had over 50,000 jobs since last quarter -- coal jobs, mining jobs -- created in this country. We had almost 7,000 mining and coal jobs created in the month of May alone.\"",
      "This is also not firmly backed by data.",
      "Let's start with the official Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers.",
      "Currently, the BLS counts about 50,000 coal mining jobs in the United States -- total. That makes it all but impossible for the first half of Pruitt's claim -- 50,000 more mining jobs since the end of last year -- to be accurate.",
      "Indeed, according to the BLS data, the actual increase in coal jobs since the end of last year was 1,300, while the monthly increase in May was 400. That's far below the increases of 50,000 and 7,000 that Pruitt cited, respectively.",
      "Based on his comments to ABC, Pruitt appears to have been referring to the broader \"mining and logging\" sector in the BLS data. But even by that standard, his numbers are inflated.",
      "The mining and logging sector has grown by 38,000 jobs since the end of last year and grew by 6,000 in May. He's close when he calls 6,000 \"almost 7,000,\" but 38,000 is well short of 50,000.",
      "And if Pruitt meant to refer to these statistics, they include logging jobs as well -- a sector he didn't reference on the shows.",
      "The coal industry has long chafed at the BLS' definition of coal-sector jobs. Terry Headley, the director of communications for the American Coal Council, said that coal employment numbers compiled independently by states are typically much larger than what BLS has found, perhaps because many states use broader definitions of who should be counted.",
      "For instance, Headley said, coal truck drivers -- probably numbering several thousand nationally -- are not broken out from the BLS data for \"truck drivers.\" The situation is similar for electricians, surveyors, mechanics, and equipment service technicians, he said.",
      "In West Virginia alone, he said, state data for 2015 show 48,327 in the category of miners, mine support, and onsite processing staff. \"If you look purely at the federal numbers you will only get about 12,000 for the state,\" he said.",
      "Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, doesn't dispute that this can have an effect on the numbers.",
      "\"It's possible that the added employment connected with moving the coal once it is removed from the ground, such as transportation and warehousing, and the use of the coal in downstream industries, such as in electric power generation and integrated steel plants, would produce a somewhat bigger employment effect,\" Burtless said.",
      "Official BLS data for the coal mining industry \"does omit many workers who work in the industry,\" said Jed Kolko, the chief economist for the jobs site Indeed.com. \"Related industries, like support activities for mining, presumably include some who work in the coal mining industry, though related industries might combine coal with oil and gas and therefore make it hard to come up with a broader total of coal-mining employees.\"",
      "Still, Burtless said that getting from 1,300 official coal-mining jobs to 50,000 additional jobs that can be credited to the sector would likely require an even more generous definition -- one that estimates how many additional jobs in the overall economy stem from the added purchasing by newly flush coal companies and miners.",
      "Headley said that such calculations for the coal sector have historically ranged from a multiplier of three to a multiplier of 11 -- that is, from three times to 11 times as many jobs created in the broader economy for every job created in coal mining.",
      "Such a wide range of estimates should serve as a yellow light, economists say, since they are subject to advocates' rosy estimates.",
      "Pruitt is at least able to point to data showing a recent increase in coal production.",
      "Data calculated by the federal Energy Department's Energy Information Administration shows that year-to-date coal production has been 17.6 percent higher than the comparable figure for 2016. And data from the Association of American Railroads shows that, the amount of coal loaded onto rail cars has been significantly higher so far this year than it was during first few months of 2016.",
      "Such data indicates that more coal has been mined and shipped in the first part of this year, even if actual job gains aren't showing up in the data yet. Still, this begs the question of whether this increase had anything to do with the Trump administration's policies.",
      "The increase in coal jobs began before Trump was elected. The job gains in the coal sector during the final five months of the Barack Obama administration -- an administration that Trump's camp blamed for waging a \"war on coal\" -- were actually slightly larger than the equivalent number for the first five months of the Trump administration, namely 1,400 versus 1,300.",
      "Moreover, good and bad times in the coal sector tend to stem more from industry-specific developments and international factors than domestic policy changes, experts said. \"Coal mining is a highly cyclical industry, making it hard to attribute ups and down to policy or political factors,\" Kolko said.",
      "A recent report in NPR put its finger on one possible factor that has boosted the coal sector in recent months -- unusually high demand for \"metallurgical\" coal, which is used for making steel, rather than for electricity generation. Metallurgical coal accounts for about about one-sixth of coal production worldwide.",
      "Art Sullivan, a mining consultant and former coal miner in Washington, Pa., told NPR that Australia, the world's leader in metallurgical coal, has faced supply-chain troubles in recent months due to rail and weather problems. This, plus higher Chinese steel production, has caused the price for Australian metallurgical steel to spike, making U.S. firms more competitive recently than they would ordinarily have been, Sullivan told NPR.",
      "Pruitt said, \"Since the fourth quarter of last year until most recently, we've added almost 50,000 jobs in the coal sector. In the month of May alone, almost 7,000 jobs.\"",
      "The official Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows strikingly smaller increases than what Pruitt said, even when taking into account his comments on other Sunday shows. Meanwhile, there is evidence that coal production and shipment is higher this year compared to early 2016, but the rise actually began under Obama and it's not clear that Trump policies have been the driving factor.",

      "The article said Kaine, the 2016 Democratic vice presidential candidate, and Lynch, Barack Obama's former attorney general, were part of \"a stunning collection of calls to violence and murder from the intolerant, unhinged leftists in the Democrat party, mainstream media, Hollywood, and the spider web of interwoven organizations and cabals like Antifa and Black Lives Matter who have effectively transformed into domestic terrorists in Trump's America.\"",

      "This fact-check focuses on the Lynch allegations and whether the video shows what Infowars said it does.",

Lynch.\" It's not clear when or where Lynch was speaking, but she seems to speaking in the context of President Donald Trump's recent inauguration. While she never mentioned Trump, the video went up a few hours before Trump would address a joint session of Congress.",
      "About a week before the video, the Homeland Security Department implemented tough new policies on deportations. The Trump administration undid civil rights protections for transgender students. Both ran counter to Obama era policies.",

I know it's a time of concern for people who see our rights being assailed, being trampled on, and even being rolled back. I know that this is difficult, but I remind you that this has never been easy. We have always had to work to move this country forward to achieve the great ideals of our founding fathers.

They've marched, they've bled yes, some of them have died. This is hard. Every good thing is. We have done this before; we can do this again.\"",

      "The new Rasmussen Poll, one of the most accurate in the 2016 Election, just out with a Trump 50% Approval Rating.That's higher than O's #'s!",
      "Rasmussen Reports retweeted the president's message (and so did more than 21,000 other accounts) despite some questionable logic.",
      "Among pollsters, Rasmussen has consistently published higher approval ratings for Trump than its peers that track presidential job approval among Americans.",
      "Its June 13-15 poll of 1,500 likely voters did show 50 percent job approval for Trump, with a sampling margin of error of 3 percent.",
      "His numbers hadn't hit the 50 percent-mark since late April, according to Rasmussen's approval index history.",
      "Rasmussen's numbers are atypical of the polls that have surveyed Trump's approval ratings. The next-closest results were still pretty far from 50 percent.",
      "An Economist/YouGov poll of 1,500 registered voters from June 11-13 showed 42 percent approval. A June 9-15 Survey Monkey poll of adults showed 43 percent. Gallup, which polls all adults on a three-day rolling basis, most recently showed 39 percent approval.",
      "When you look at polling more broadly, Rasmussen really sticks out.",
      "The RealClearPolitics.com average of polls from May 30-June 17 shows 40 percent job approval -- a full 10 percentage points lower than the rate Trump touted in his tweet. FiveThirtyEight performs a similar comprehensive reflection of polling data, and it came in even lower -- 38.7 percent approval (and 55.4 percent disapproval) by Trump's 150th day in office.",
      "What about Trump's assertion that Obama fared more poorly? It's not the case if you use the most apples-to-apples comparison: Rasmussen's own polling at this stage of his presidency.",
      "Rasmussen's results for Obama during the same period in June 2009 do not show an approval rating below Trump's 50 percent. Obama's approval ratings were between 54 and 58 percent through June 9-16, 2009, and they did not dip below 50 percent until late July of that year.",
      "Gallup's tracking of Obama's job performance showed a higher mark of 60 percent approval at that time.",
      "Of course, Obama's approval rating did dip below the high 50s later in his presidency. Obama's ratings in the Rasmussen poll did consistently fall below 50 percent from the fall of 2009 to the summer of 2012, and again from the summer of 2013 to the spring of 2016.",
      "However, experts caution that it's most appropriate to compare presidents' approval ratings at the same point in their presidency. Historically, most presidents have tended to have higher approval ratings early in the \"honeymoon\" period of their tenure before they sink, as some voters begin to tire of their policies.",
      "In addition, Obama periodically did reach 50 percent or more in Rasmussen polls even during his weaker periods, and when he didn't, he was often within a point or two of that mark. This means it's possible to do some reverse cherry-picking that makes Obama look better than Trump.",
      "Trump's overall polling right now is far below what all past presidents have polled at an equivalent point in their first term. (Here's a comparison of Gallup approval ratings for Trump's predecessors, going back to Harry Truman.)",
      "One reason why Rasmussen has shown higher ratings for Trump stems from its methodology. For one, it polls likely voters.",
      "Registered voters tend to offer higher job approval than surveys of adults more generally. And surveys of likely voters -- Rasmussen's approach -- offer higher job approval ratings still.",
      "\"As we move from all Americans, to registered voters, to likely voters, and to actual voters, the sample becomes more educated, more wealthy, and more Republican,\" said Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. \"Statistical weighting can reduce the bias. Rasmussen weights, but we know little about Rasmussen's weighting procedures. The details matter.\"",
      "Meanwhile, polls that use live callers have been showing lower approval ratings than polls conducted by online or automated survey. Rasmussen uses automated surveys.",
      "\"Automated polls only call landlines, which means they miss the roughly half (!!) of the American population that uses mobile phones only,\" FiveThirtyEight editor in chief Nate Silver wrote in February.",
      "\"This matters because cell-only individuals tend to be younger, lower income, and more urban, all of which bias landline-only surveys in a conservative direction,\" Smith said.",
      "Each of these factors help explain the higher results for Rasmussen in Trump's favor. We reached out to Rasmussen but did not hear back by deadline.",
      "Finally, what to make of Trump's implication that Rasmussen should be more trusted because it was more accurate than other pollsters about the 2016 election?",
      "The strongest evidence comes from looking at the final pre-election national polls.",
      "According to the rundown in RealClearPolitics, Rasmussen was the only pollster to get the popular vote result -- a two-point Hillary Clinton win -- correct in its final pre-election poll. Two pollsters (Monmouth University and NBC News/Survey Monkey) had Clinton winning by six points; four (ABC News/Washington Post, CBS News, Fox News, and Economist/YouGov) had Clinton winning by four, two (Bloomberg and Reuters/Ipsos) had Clinton winning by three, one (IBD/TIPP) had Trump winning by two, and one had Trump winning by five (Los Angeles Times/USC).",
      "However, it's worth taking this with a grain of salt. First, the polls that had Clinton winning by two or three points were all very close to the mark once margins of error are taken into account. And second, Rasmussen was lucky to have its two-point margin come during the final pre-election poll. During the last week before the election, its daily results were scattered -- Clinton by three, tie, tie, Trump by three, tie, and Clinton by two.",
      "Overall, FiveThirtyEight's comprehensive pollster ratings gives Rasmussen the mediocre grade of C-plus, and it found a two-point Republican bias in its polls. (This rating did not encompass the entire 2016 campaign, but it did go back earlier; it factored in 657 polls by Rasmussen.)",
      "Of course, Trump would not be the first president to tout an outlying poll result.",
      "\"It is hardly new that presidents choose to talk about polls that support their view of the world and themselves,\" said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.",
      "Trump said, \"The new Rasmussen Poll, one of the most accurate in the 2016 Election, just out with a Trump 50% Approval Rating.That's higher than O's #'s!\"",
      "There's a grain of truth here: Rasmussen did put out that result two days before Trump's tweet, and Rasmussen was closest to the mark among pollsters in its final pre-election survey.",
      "However, Trump has engaged in some serious cherry-picking. Other polling in this time frame shows approval ratings for Trump that are seven to 11 percentage points below Rasmussen's finding. And contrary to Trump's assertion, Obama's numbers in the same poll at the same point in his presidency were higher than Trump's current results.",

      "\"Under the Rules of Professional Responsibility, attorneys are permitted to participate in matters involving their former firm's clients so long as they have no confidential information about the client and did not participate in the representation,\" said Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesperson. \"The department's ethics experts have considered the relevant issues and determined that Mr. Mueller's appointment as special counsel and those hired from his former firm are consistent with the rules of professional responsibility.\"",

      "On the question of campaign contributions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in his testimony before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on June 20 he saw no problems with the political donations from some special counsel staffers. When Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked whether political donations are a reason to disqualify someone from working on the investigation, Rosenstein answered, \"No, senator, it is not a disqualification. It is not.\"",
      "According to Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, Congress has a longstanding concern about the possibility of partisanship in the federal workplace, leading it to place restrictions on partisan political activity through the Hatch Act. While the Hatch Act prohibits employees from campaigning for or against a subject of the investigation, financial contributions are permitted.",
      "\"The Hatch Act places federal employees under two different categories, and some employees are subject to tighter restrictions on their partisan political activities,\" Clark said. That includes those working on Justice Department criminal investigations. \"But even those folks are permitted to make political contributions.\"",
      "\"If someone has some kind of bias against someone or an association with or against, that's not fair, and there's a specific federal ethics regulation that requires federal officials who are participating in a proceeding like a criminal investigation to be able to be impartial and have the appearance of impartiality,\" she added. \"Even staffers who have represented Clinton don't fall into that category.\"",

He also contributed $15,550 to Democratic congressional candidates since 2002; $2,000 to Democratic presidential candidates since 1999; $2,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee; and $1,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2009. He is the only staffer who also contributed to a Republican congressional candidate. He gave $2,500 to U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, in 2015.",

Dreeben shows up in FEC files as having donated $1,000 to Hillary for America on June 27, 2006, this is a different Dreeben in Chicago. The deputy solicitor general has made no campaign contributions.",

      "In an interview Sunday, ABC news host George Stephanopoulos brought up the bill's projected $800 billion in Medicaid savings and asked Conway if that undermined the president's campaign promise to spare Medicaid from cuts.",
      "\"These are not cuts to Medicaid, George,\" Conway said on This Week on June 25. \"This slows the rate for the future.\"",
      "Conway was weighing in on a long-running debate over what qualifies as a cut.",
      "And on one level, she has a point, we at PolitiFact found. Future savings are not always \"cuts.\" But in the case of the GOP health care bill, there are indeed cuts that go beyond dollars spent.",
      "To first vet Conway's statement that there are no cuts to Medicaid, we need to begin with a few basic numbers.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that under current law, from 2018 through 2026, the federal government would spend about $4.62 trillion dollars on Medicaid.",
      "For the Senate bill, the CBO estimated that total Medicaid spending would be about $770 billion less.",
      "But you can also compare how much Washington spends in 2018 the first year a health care bill would take effect and what it would spend in 2026.",
      "If things stay as they are, spending goes from $415 billion to $624 billion.",
      "Under the Senate Republican bill, spending goes from about $403 billion to about $460 billion.",
      "Point being, spending increases under either scenario, it just increases at a far slower rate under the Senate bill.",
      "This graph from the CBO shows the trajectories for both.",
      "",
      "The Senate bill takes several steps to restrain Medicaid spending.",
      "It rolls back who is eligible. Before Obamacare, Medicaid covered low-income children, pregnant women, elderly and disabled individuals, and some parents, but excluded other low-income adults. Under the Affordable Care Act, 31 states and the District of Columbia exercised the option to make Medicaid available to anyone making up to 133 percent of federal poverty. For a family of three, that would be about $27,000 a year. The Senate bill eliminates that option as of January 2018.",
      "This shuts out the Medicaid option for over 2.5 million people in states that didn't expand eligibility.",
      "The bill also makes federal payments to expansion states less generous. Under Obamacare, Washington covers at least 90 percent of the cost of covering people in the expansion group. That's a better deal than the regular match, which can be anywhere from 50 to about 70 percent. The Senate bill phases out the higher rate for expansion states and by 2024, the match falls back to the regular rate.",
      "The bill further ends Medicaid's days as an open-ended promise to cover a certain percentage of a state's costs. Instead, the bill shifts the program to a capped amount. The cap might apply on a per-person basis, or states might opt to take their money as a block grant. In either case, the amount would rise each year, but using a lower inflation factor than is used today.",
      "It's the specific nature of those changes that are more important than the total dollars spent.",
      "When Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, it included less money for Medicare over the years. In a mirror image of today's debate, Republicans, notably House Speaker Paul Ryan, accused Democrats of cutting a vital health care program for the elderly. Democrats argued back that spending increased.",
      "We did a series of fact-checks about the back-and-forth and generally rated the Republican attacks Half True.",
      "Then, Democrats reduced payment levels to health care providers. Now, Republicans propose reducing payments to states. But at least in terms of the money trends, both situations follow the same general outlines -- with one key difference:",
      "The Democrats didn't change the eligible population, and the Republicans do.",
      "That's a cut. Fewer people will have access to Medicaid no matter how much money is spent.",
      "Conway, in fact, highlighted the Republican goal.",
      "\"Medicaid's imperative, its founding was meant to help the poor, the sick, the needy, the disabled children, some elderly women, particularly pregnant women,\" she said on ABC. \"We are trying to get Medicaid back to its original moorings.\"",
      "Conway said that Republicans are not cutting the Medicaid program. The Republican health care proposals would slow the rate at which Medicaid spending increases, but spending would still increase.",
      "However, the proposals include policy changes that will leave fewer people eligible for Medicaid. That's a cut.",

      "During an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., didn't hold back in his criticism of Republican efforts to roll back the Affordable Care Act: He said such legislative efforts will literally be deadly.",
      "\"What the Republican proposal (in the House) does is throw 23 million Americans off of health insurance,\" Sanders told host Chuck Todd. \"What a part of Harvard University -- the scientists there -- determine is when you throw 23 million people off of health insurance, people with cancer, people with heart disease, people with diabetes, thousands of people will die.\"",
      "Sanders continued, \"I wish I didn't have to say it. This is not me. This is study after study making this point. It is common sense.\"",
      "Even if it seems like common sense that insurance would save lives, would it be on the scale of \"thousands,\" as Sanders said? And would legitimate studies show that?",
      "When we contacted Sanders' office, spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis cited two sources.",
      "One is the \"Harvard study\" Sanders mentioned -- published on June 22, 2017, by the liberal Center for American Progress. It was co-authored by a Harvard professor of social epidemiology; two medical students who graduated from Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and two policy specialists at the Center for American Progress.",
      "To come up with their estimates, the authors of the Harvard-Center for American Progress report adapted the results of a peer-reviewed 2014 study of the Massachusetts state health care law -- a law that was a model for the Affordable Care Act. The 2014 study was lead-authored by Harvard professor Benjamin D. Sommers.",
      "The Harvard-Center for American Progress study projected that there would be one excess death for every 830 people who lose coverage as a result of the AHCA. Using Congressional Budget Office projections of the impact of the House version of the bill, the authors estimated an additional 217,000 deaths over the next decade, or 21,700 per year.",
      "The second piece of evidence Sanders' office cited was an op-ed by yet more health policy specialists who are affiliated with Harvard -- David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler, who are professors of public health at Hunter College-City University of New York as well as lecturers at Harvard Medical School.",
      "The op-ed -- published on Jan. 23, 2017, well before either chamber's Republican health care bill was introduced -- used as its basis a different study lead-authored by Sommers. This 2012 study tracked what happened after states expanded Medicaid.",
      "Adapting the findings of the 2012 study to a scenario in which 20 million Americans lost coverage -- which turned out to be lower than what the CBO found for the House bill -- Himmelstein and Woolhandler estimated that there would be 43,956 deaths annually due to the GOP's health policy changes.",
      "It's worth noting, however, that both of these projections come from the ideological left. As we noted, the Center for American Progress is a liberal think tank. And Himmelstein and Woolhandler are founders of Physicians for a National Health Program, a group that advocates for single-payer national health insurance -- a proposal that is even further to the left than the Affordable Care Act.",
      "So can Sanders' assertion be supported by the peer-reviewed literature alone?",
      "In our previous fact-checking of this issue, we found at least seven academic papers that detected a link between securing health insurance and a decline in mortality. Here's a rundown.",
      "In 2002, a panel of more than a dozen medical specialists convened by the federally chartered Institute of Medicine estimated that 18,000 Americans had died in 2000 because they were uninsured. In January 2008, Stan Dorn, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, published a paper that sought to update the IOM study with newer data. Replicating the study's methodology, Dorn concluded that the figure should be increased to 22,000.",
      "A 2009 American Journal of Public Health study concluded that a lack of health insurance \"is associated with as many as 44,789 deaths in the United States, more than those caused by kidney disease.\"",
      "Three studies looked at state-level expansions of Medicaid and in each case found \"significant\" improvements in mortality after such expansions of coverage. These include a 2012 New England Journal of Medicine study of New York, Maine, and Arizona by Harvard researchers, and a 2014 study of Massachusetts by researchers from Harvard and the Urban Institute. (These were the two articles that formed the basis of the analyses cited by Sanders' staff.)",
      "A 2014 study published by the blog of the health policy publication Health Affairs looked at states that, at the time, had declined to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. It estimated that the 25 states studied would have collectively avoided between 7,000 and 17,000 deaths.",
      "A 2014 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found improved survival rates for young adults with cancer after securing insurance under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "A 2017 study in the journal Medical Care looked at a provision of the Affordable Care Act that allows young adults to be covered under a parent's policy. The study found a decline in mortality among this population from diseases amenable to preventive treatment. (Mortality from trauma, such as car accidents, saw no decrease, as would be expected.)",
      "We found two papers with results that were more equivocal.",
      "A paper published in April 2009 in HSR: Health Services Research. In it, Richard Kronick of the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine at the University of California (San Diego) School of Medicine, raised questions about the conclusions of the seminal Institute of Medicine study from 2002. Kronick's study adjusted the data -- as the IOM had not -- for a number of demographic and health factors, including status as a smoker and body mass index, and found that doing so removed the excess number of deaths found in the original study.",
      "A 2013 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine co-authored by Katherine Baicker of Harvard University compared about 6,000 patients in Oregon who got coverage through a 2008 Medicaid expansion and about 6,000 who didn't. While the study found improvements in out-of-pocket medical spending and lower rates of depression among those who got coverage, key benchmarks for physical health -- including blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar -- did not improve in such patients.",
      "But even the two lead authors of the more equivocal studies have told us that the scholarly record demonstrates that having health insurance saves lives, and that not having insurance can lead to additional deaths.",
      "We asked several of the authors of these papers whether they believe Sanders' assertion of \"thousands\" of deaths is generally supported by the scholarly evidence. We heard back from three of them.",
      "\" Thousands' is completely fair,\" Dorn said.",
      "Baicker agreed. \"It is of course difficult to pin down an exact number of deaths that would be caused by a specific new policy,\" she said. \"But a number like thousands' does not seem unreasonable, based on the available evidence.\"",
      "And Sommers -- whose work formed the indirect basis of the studies cited by Sanders -- concurred.",
      "\"I agree that it's challenging to pin down an exact number on this,\" Sommers said. But overall, the academic evidence \"certainly gets you into the range of thousands of deaths per year.\"",
      "Sanders said, \"When you throw 23 million people off of health insurance -- people with cancer, people with heart disease, people with diabetes -- thousands of people will die. This is study after study making this point.\"",
      "Sanders' statement on Meet the Press was phrased generally enough to be defensible. We found ample evidence in the academic literature to suggest that legislation on the scale of the House bill would produce \"thousands' of additional deaths.",
      "That said, we can't say with any specificity how many deaths will occur. It's important to note that the studies provide estimates only, and each study found a slightly different result. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True."

      "While there was never the expectation that the ACA would bring the number of uninsured Americans down to zero, there is a viable argument that the ACA did not do enough to expand coverage. But neither bill proposed in Congress now would reverse this trend.",
      "\"While there are proposals that could reduce the number of uninsured including expanding Medicaid in more states and providing more generous financial assistance to people buying coverage on the individual market those are generally policies that the administration and its congressional allies have opposed,\" said Matt Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy in Brookings' Economic Studies Program.",
      "The states that elected not to expand Medicaid coverage account for about 2.6 million of the uninsured population, according to Kaiser Family Foundation Executive Vice President Diane Rowland.",
      "That number may increase because the Senate bill cuts federal assistance to Medicaid. States that have opted into the expansion program might begin scaling back coverage.",
      "According to the CBO, \"despite being eligible for premium tax credits, few low-income people would purchase any plan.\"",
      "The 3 million people who are uninsured because they make too much money for subsidies will not be covered, either, as the poverty level that qualifies people for subsidies is increasing.",
      "\"It would lower the subsidy levels and it would make them much more costly for older people who are pre-Medicare, so you would expect fewer of them to try to take up coverage and many who have coverage to drop it,\" Rowland said.",

      "President Donald Trump recently claimed that in the five months he's been in office, his administration has deported about half of MS-13 gang members, one of the largest criminal organizations in the United States around since the 1980s.",
      "Trump singled out enforcement efforts against the MS-13 gang during an immigration roundtable discussion on two House bills written to withhold funds from jurisdictions that shield immigrants and to impose stricter penalties for criminal immigrants who re-enter the country.",
      "MS-13 gang members are \"bad people, and we've gotten many of them out already. You know, we're pretty much at the 50 percent mark,\" Trump said June 28. \"We're getting them out as fast as we can get them out, and we're freeing up towns.\"",
      "Trump's comment caught our attention since this is one of the most notorious gangs in the country. Is he halfway there in deporting thousands of MS-13 gang members?",
      "Not exactly.",
      "There's an estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States. The latest data shows immigration officials have deported 2,798 gang members in fiscal year 2017 that's members of all gangs and includes several months when former President Barack Obama was in office.",
      "Trump's June 28 remarks weren't the first he's made about MS-13 and his administration's efforts against them. At a rally this month in Iowa, he told supporters his administration was \"moving them out of the country by the thousands.\"",
      "In April, he falsely tweeted that Obama's policies allowed MS-13 to form across the United States, and again that his administration was removing them fast. But multiple experts told us there is no evidence Obama's policies caused the gang's growth in the country.",
      "MS-13 grew out of poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s.",
      "It's grown into an international criminal organization with more than 30,000 members worldwide, the Justice Department said in an April 18, 2017, fact sheet.",
      "It's difficult to peg down exactly how many MS-13 gang members there are in the United States.",
      "Trump's Justice Department in April said there were more than 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States. FactCheck.org noted that for years the 10,000 figure has been a consistent estimate.",
      "We asked the White House for evidence backing Trump's claim, but did not get an on-the-record response.",
      "A specific number of MS-13 gang members deported is not available because officials don't track removals by specific gang, Dani Bennett, spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement previously told us. (The FBI says there's around 33,000 violent street gangs, motorcycle gangs, and prison gangs criminally active in the U.S. and Puerto Rico with an estimated 1.4 million members.)",
      "But ICE \"does specifically target MS-13 members for arrest and removal on the basis of their immigration violations,\" Bennett said, adding that deportations include foreign fugitives wanted for crimes committed abroad and who are removable under U.S. immigration law.",
      "So far in fiscal year 2017, ICE said it has removed 2,798 gang members.",
      "Even if all of them were MS-13 gang members, that would still be short of Trump's claim that \"we're pretty much at the 50 percent mark\" since the Justice Department in April said there's an estimated 10,000 gang members in the country.",
      "Also, fiscal year 2017 started Oct. 1, 2016, when Obama was still in office.",
      "Trump said, \"We're pretty much at the 50 percent mark\" on deportations of MS-13 gang members.",
      "Trump's Justice Department has said there's an estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States.",
      "The latest available data from ICE shows 2,798 gang members have been removed in fiscal year 2017. But that includes members of all gangs, not just MS-13. Even if all were MS-13, that would not be half of the estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the country. And fiscal year 2017 includes more than three months that Obama was in office.",

      "President Donald Trump's White House offered dubious explanations on the Sunday shows to defend Trump's Twitter accusation that former President Barack Obama wiretapped phones at Trump Tower before the 2016 election.",
      "The president, a spokeswoman said on ABC's This Week, didn't come up with the storyline out of thin air. He was echoing reports from \"multiple news outlets.\"",
      "\"Everybody acts like President Trump is the one that came up with this idea and just threw it out there,\" said deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on March 5. \"There are multiple news outlets that have reported this.\"",
      "At one point in the segment, Sanders specifically named the New York Times and BBC as news outlets that have covered the wiretapping allegations. Show host Martha Raddatz pushed back and said Trump started this issue with his specific tweet.",
      "Sanders repeated her point: \"I hardly say he started this when there were multiple news reports prior to that.\"",
      "If the basis of Trump's comment is media reports, he doesn't have a case.",
      "A White House spokesperson sent PolitiFact five articles from the BBC, HeatStreet, the New York Times, the National Review and a transcript from Fox News' Special Report with Bret Baier as evidence of Sanders' claim.",
      "Before we get into those, it's worth noting that many news outlets have suggested Trump's remark was inspired by a March 3 post on Breitbart News. The post was not included by Trump's team as backup, but the Breitbart article links to some of the other reports.",
      "The Breitbart article followed up on comments by Mark Levin on a March 2 segment of his conservative radio show. During the show, Levin claimed Obama's administration used \"police state\" tactics in the fall to watch over Trump's team.",
      "Trump sent his tweet early March 4. As of March 5, he had still not provided evidence.",
      "\"How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!\" Trump wrote.",
      "How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!",
      "The Breitbart article recapped 10 news events of the 2016 campaign that laid the foundation for Obama's administration to \"eavesdrop on the Trump campaign.\" Among the events included as an example is the Wikileaks release of emails from Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, which the Clinton campaign used to blame \"Trump and the Russians.",
      "The Breitbart article also mentions two requests under the the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which grants a court the authority to grant (or deny) warrants for electronic surveillance. The reporting about FISA requests is taken from a Nov. 7, 2016, report from the conservative-leaning website called HeatStreet. HeatStreet published an article, it said, based on two unnamed sources.",
      "\"The FBI sought, and was granted, a FISA court warrant in October, giving counterintelligence permission to examine the activities of U.S. persons' in Donald Trump's campaign with ties to Russia,\" reads a line from the HeatStreet piece.",
      "The story says the FISA warrant was in relation to an investigation to the \"Trump campaign, and its alleged links to two banks; SVB Bank and Russia's Alfa Bank.\"",
      "Other reports about this FISA requests come from the BBC and the Guardian. (The White House did not send the Guardian over as evidence.) Importantly, these sources do not back up Trump's accusation that Obama himself ordered the wiretap as part of political sabotage.",
      "On Jan. 12, the BBC reported that lawyers from the National Security Division in the Department of Justice filed applications to the court that handles intelligence matters related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or FISA.",
      "\"A lawyer outside the Department of Justice but familiar with the case told me that three of Trump's associates were the subject of the inquiry,\" wrote Paul Wood, a British journalists who wrote the article in first person. The article did not say anything about Trump Tower.",
      "Six months earlier, the Guardian reported that the FBI applied for a warrant to monitor members of Trump's teams interactions with Russia from the FISA court in June. The story was light on the details. It said the June application was turned down by the court, and briefly mentioned a report that the FBI was granted a warrant in October, but that has yet to be confirmed.",
      "Trump's team also sent over two articles from the New York Times. These articles are about intelligence probes related to Trump associates and Russian officials.",
      "The first article, published on Jan. 12, reported that \"American law enforcement and intelligence agencies were examining communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of then- President-elect Trump.\"",
      "At one point, the article indicates that intelligence reports stemming from the intercepts were given to Obama's administration.",
      "\"One official said intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the White House,\" it reads.",
      "The other article from Jan. 12 is about the Obama's administration expanding the powers of the National Security Agency through new rules that relaxed limits on \"collecting satellite transmissions, phone calls and emails that cross network switches abroad, and messages between people abroad that cross domestic network switches.\"",
      "Trump's team also cited an article from the National Review as well as a March 3 Fox News interview between host Bret Baier and House Speaker Paul Ryan. The National Review article repeats the same information from HeatStreet. Baier asked Ryan about the report on FISA requests, which Ryan said he had not heard about. To be clear, that isn't an example of Fox independently confirming the HeatStreet report.",
      "It's worth noting that Obama's director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, said on NBC's Meet the Press he was not aware of any wiretaps that Trump alleged. And Obama, through a spokesman, has denied wiretapping Trump Tower. And Obama officials have also said a president cannot unilaterally order a wiretap.",

      "Trump's spokeswoman made it sound as if Trump was merely following a well-documented string of reports, but that is not the case. A few of the reports allude to the FBI requesting permission from FISA to eavesdrop on Trump's associates, but none (minus the anonymously sourced website) definitively said the probes centered on Trump himself or came directly from Obama.",

The vast majority of detainees who fall into Trump's total were actually released during the administration of President George W. Bush.",

      "About every six months, the Director of National Intelligence releases figures about detainees transferred from Guantanamo and how many are known to have re-engaged in some sort of terrorist activity.",

      "So in the 15 years between when Guantanamo opened in 2002 and when the latest data was collected in 2016, 122 detainees were transferred out of the prison who the government believes have returned to some sort of terrorist activity.",
      "However, just nine of those transfers happened during the Obama administration. The remaining 113 or over 92 percent happened under Bush.",

      "\"I do have concerns over the use of such figures without explanation or context,\" he said. \"Many of those released are handed over to foreign states who assume responsibility for them. Tracking their activities after they leave Guantanamo can be problematic.\"",
      "In June 2014, the New America Foundation, a centrist think tank, compiled its own numbers of released former detainees, using Pentagon reports, news stories and other public information. At the time there were 620 released prisoners, and the foundation found that 54 of them \"are either confirmed to be or suspected of engaging in militant activities against either the U.S. or non-U.S. targets.\" That was about one-third of the government's figure of 184 at the time. The foundation has not updated the report since then.",

      "One of the arguments Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price made about why substantial changes in federal health care law were needed was that the Affordable Care Act, sometimes called Obamacare, had failed in one of its goals -- to cut down on emergency room use.",
      "Because emergency rooms by law cannot turn patients away, they can become a health care provider of last resort, even for more minor conditions that could be handled just as well -- and more inexpensively -- in a doctor's office.",
      "\"One of the things that the previous administration said was that they were going to be able to drive folks away from one of the most expensive areas for the provision of health care, and that is the emergency rooms,\" Price said at a White House briefing on March 7, 2017. \"In fact, they did just the opposite.\"",
      "Is Price correct that emergency room usage has gone up -- not down -- since passage of the law? Our research suggests that Price has a strong case.",
      "Did Obama say the law would lower emergency room use?",
      "He certainly expressed hope that it would. He mentioned it during an address on health care to a joint session of Congress, and during a nationally televised town hall on health care on June 24, 2009. During the town hall, Obama said this:",
      "\"One of the areas where we can potentially see some saving is -- a lot of those patients are being seen in the emergency room anyway, and if we are increasing prevention, if we are increasing wellness programs, we're reducing the amount of emergency room care, then that frees up doctors and resources to provide the kind of primary care that will keep people healthier, but also allow them to see more patients and hopefully give more time to patients, as well.\"",
      "Has emergency room use gone up since the law has gone into effect?",
      "Different pieces of data vary somewhat, but all in all, there's strong evidence that emergency room usage hasn't declined much, if at all, since the law largely took effect in 2013. There's also evidence that it has increased.",
      "Here are some examples of studies that looked at this question.",
      "May 2015: A survey of more than 2,000 emergency-room physicians by the American College of Emergency Physicians asked whether the volume of patients in their emergency room had dropped or risen after the law took effect. The results: 28 percent said it had \"increased greatly\" and 47 percent said it had \"increased slightly.\" Combined, that means three-quarters of emergency room doctors saw an increase.",
      "February 2016: A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at the change in emergency room use between 2013 (which was largely before the law) and 2014 (which was largely after the law took effect). \"ER use overall has not changed significantly after the first full year of ACA implementation,\" the report concludes.",
      "August 2016: A study in the journal Annals of Emergency Medicine looked at emergency room use in Illinois by adults between 2011 and 2015, separating out patterns of visits before and after the law took effect. The study found that emergency room visits in the state \"increased after ACA health insurance expansion. ... A large post-ACA increase in Medicaid visits and a modest increase in privately insured visits outpaced a large reduction in (emergency room) visits by uninsured patients.\"",
      "So the studies pointed toward a modest increase in ER use.",
      "Two other recent studies looked at state-based scenarios that mirrored the types of expansions of coverage in Obama's law. Both of them -- a March 2014 study of Massachusetts and an October 2016 study of Illinois -- found increased emergency room use after coverage was expanded.",
      "Why isn't emergency room use going down?",
      "Experts cite a mix of reasons.",
      "Medicaid reimbursement rates are lower than those for private insurance, so appointments at doctors' offices may be hard to obtain for those who received Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act. In addition, \"two-thirds of emergency visits occur on weekends and when doctors' offices are closed,\" said Laura Gore, a spokeswoman for the American College of Emergency Physicians.",
      "Demographics may play a role, too. Senior citizens are growing as a percentage of the population, and older Americans are likelier to have chronic health problems that require an emergency room visit, Gore said.",
      "In fact, the trend of growing emergency room use predates the enactment of the Affordable Care Act.",
      "\"Emergency department use has been rising since they were popularized after World War II,\" said Scott M. Dresden, a physician and assistant professor at Northwestern University who co-wrote the Illinois study. \"Research on health services use since the 1970s has shown that providing patients with assistance for health care costs, such as insurance, leads to increased health services use. So it's not particularly surprising that providing patients with insurance didn't decrease emergency department use.\"",
      "But the biggest factor may be force of habit.",
      "\"Old habits are hard to break,\" said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. \"People who were used to seeking care in ERs may continue to go there for a while. When Kaiser first started taking Medicaid patients, many continued their use of the ER for routine care like they had always done. It took a while to wean them away.\"",
      "Katherine Baicker, a professor of health economics at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health and co-author of the Oregon study, agreed.",
      "\"Expanding health insurance coverage leads to greater use of care across many settings, including the doctor's office, the pharmacy, the hospital, and the emergency room,\" she said. \"This is what one might expect from the basic economics: Medicaid took health care that was expensive and made it free, so people used more of it.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Price said the Obama administration said \"they were going to be able to drive folks away from one of the most expensive areas for the provision of health care, and that is the emergency rooms. In fact, they did just the opposite.\"",
      "While the data varies a bit from study to study, the findings generally fail to provide any evidence that emergency room use has decreased after the law took effect. Indeed, several studies found increases in emergency room use, though modestly. Price overstated the case slightly, but he's basically correct. We rate the statement Mostly True."

      "During a segment on ABC's This Week, White House Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney pointed to the CBO's track record on the ACA as evidence that the agency isn't capable of assessing a large piece of legislation.",
      "\"If the CBO was right about Obamacare to begin with, there'd be 8 million more people on Obamacare today than there actually are,\" Mulvaney said March 12. \"So, I love the folks at the CBO, they work really hard. They do. Sometimes we ask them to do stuff that they're not capable of doing.\"",
      "This talking point has been popping up a lot in the last week.",

In addition, at a March 8 press conference, White House spokesperson Sean Spicer, said \"If you're looking at the CBO for accuracy, you're looking in the wrong place.\"",

      "At the end of 2016, more than 11.5 million individuals actually signed up for 2017 coverage, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "That's a difference of 9.5 million enrollees, even more than the figure Mulvaney provided.",
      "It's also possible Mulvaney was referring to CBO's March 2010 estimate of the reduction in the number of uninsured people. The CBO predicted 30 million fewer people would be uninsured in 2016 because of the ACA. However, in March 2016, the CBO reduced its estimate of the same quantity to 22 million.",
      "That's a difference of 8 million people on the mark.",
      "Still, experts said CBO's forecasts were reasonable at the time.",
      "\"With respect to precise quantitative point estimates, the differences between CBO's estimates and actual experience are well within the range that I would expect given the scope of the change CBO was being asked to analyze,\" said Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy in Brookings' Economic Studies Program.",
      "Fiedler also noted that CBO's \"big picture\" assessment of the impact of the ACA on insurance coverage was on point. Specifically, the agency estimated a significant decrease in the number of people without health insurance that would leave the uninsured rate at a historic low, which is what occurred, he said.",
      "In addition, the figure ignores the fact that the 2010 prediction couldn't account the Supreme Court decision about Medicaid expansion that allowed each state to decide for itself. Nineteen states have refused to expand Medicaid eligibility.",
      "According to a 2015 report from the Commonwealth Fund, the CBO overestimated enrollee total, but still offered projections closer to reality than four other forecasters (the Office of the Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the RAND Corporation, the Urban Institute; and the Lewin Group).",
      "Importantly, the CBO reduced its projection of how many people would get health insurance this year through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, from 21 million to 13 million. Initially, CBO analysts believed exchange enrollment would be higher in part because employers would drop insurance plans in favor of the marketplaces. That has not occurred.",
      "They're not capable'",
      "Just because the CBO overestimated one measure of the Affordable Care Act in the past is not a reason enough to believe that they will miss in the same direction in the future, Fielder said.",
      "In fact, the CBO continuously adjusts their projections to incorporate new data, research, and experience, so if anything they shouldn't repeat the same mistakes.",
      "With respect to the House bill, the CBO has the advantage of having just seen how implementing the ACA impacted insurance coverage.",
      "\"That experience will be particularly helpful in evaluating the effects of rolling back provisions of the ACA, meaning that, if anything, one should probably expect estimates of this legislation to be more accurate than CBO's estimates of the effects of enacting the ACA,\" Fielder said.",
      "No prediction will ever be perfect, but for the most part, experts who have studied the CBO have found their projections to be largely sound.",
      "For example, the National Tax Journal in 1988 concluded that short-run projections from the CBO do not contain bias. A 2000 report comparing the forecasting of the CBO and the Federal Reserve Board concluded that, \"The most accurate forecasting is done by the CBO, with the Fed a close second.\"",
      "Even the CBO released its own report in November 2015 that looked at how accurate their predictions have been, as well as what factors have contributed to forecasting errors.",
      "On average, between 1982 and 2014, the CBO overestimated two-year revenue forecasts by 1.1 percent and six-year projections by about 5.3 percent.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Mulvaney said, \"If the CBO was right about Obamacare to begin with, there'd be 8 million more people on Obamacare today than there actually are.\" Mulvaney went on to say that the CBO may not be capable of assessing the GOP's replacement plan.",
      "The initial CBO analysis of the Affordable Care Act did forecast that more people would participate in health care exchanges than actually did, but the CBO has revised those estimates. Moreover, independent analyses, as well as experts agree that the CBO offers some of the best estimates given the information available at the time.",
      "Mulvaney's statement is partially accurate, but misses context that would give readers a different picture of the CBO. We rate this claim Half True."

During a joint address to Congress, he said that his plan incorporated the ideas of both Republicans and Democrats. We rated that claim Mostly False, because many of the amendments Republicans introduced were technical in nature.",

Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., the Senate version was the only one that moved forward. But Republicans offered changes in the committees that considered the bills before the whole chambers voted on them.",
      "For example, 788 amendments were submitted during the ACA's markup in the Senate Committee for Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee (HELP). Three quarters of them were filed by the committee's Republican members, according to John McDonough in his book Inside National Health Reform. Of those, 161 were adopted in whole or revised form.",
      "Yet as we reported at the time, those amendments were mostly technical. Only two of those Republican amendments were passed via roll-call vote. One of these amendments required members of Congress and congressional staff to enroll in the government-run option and the other involved biologics medication.",
      "The Senate Finance Committee took up another version of the bill. Senators initially offered 564 amendments. During that markup, about six Republican amendments were adopted via roll call vote, and others were adopted by unanimous consent, without objection, and via voice vote, according to coverage by Congressional Quarterly. Parts of this bill merged with the bill the HELP committee marked up to become the final law.",

    "body-text": [
      "Some blogs this week circulated a bombastic claim about the House Republican health care plan: that it would make sexual assault a pre-existing condition that might result in denied coverage.",
      "\"Under Trumpcare plan, rape would be considered a pre-existing condition,\" said the Resistance Report May 3.",
      "\"In Trump's America, rape is a pre-existing condition,\" read a headline by the Cut, a New York Magazine blog.",
      "We found similar headlines on Bustle and the Intellectualist, as well as in some viral tweets.",
      "We should say right off the bat that the Cut has since changed its headline and issued a correction, as did Mic. The updated headlines say sexual assault \"could\" be a pre-existing condition, which is more accurate because it is not so definitive.",
      "Here's what's wrong about the viral narrative.",
      "Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because a person has a pre-existing medical condition.",
      "Republicans' Affordable Care Act replacement the American Health Care Act, which the House passed May 4 weakens those protections.",
      "These blog posts get at a real problem with the Republican bill if it were to become law. Victims of sexual assault could, conceivably, find themselves in a situation where they can't afford insurance because of medical issues that stem from their assault.",
      "But the headlines that say the GOP bill makes sexual assault a pre-existing condition are hyperbolic based on the what the bill actually says.",
      "They stoke fears that the bill singles out victims of sexual assault, limiting their access to health care specifically.",
      "But the Republican bill doesn't pinpoint any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition; that's something the insurance companies or individual states would decide. As it stands, anyone with a pre-existing condition could face problems.",
      "Problems prior to the Affordable Care Act",
      "The blogs discuss anecdotal stories of women who, prior to the Affordable Care Act, were sexually assaulted and then sought treatment stemming from that assault. Later, when these women tried to purchase health insurance, they were denied coverage.",
      "These women weren't necessarily denied coverage because of the sexual assault; rather, it was because of residual treatment they sought afterward, such as taking HIV-preventative medication or seeing a therapist.",
      "None of the several health insurance experts we consulted were aware of insurance companies with policies that specify \"sexual assault\" or \"rape\" as a condition to consider when evaluating someone's eligibility. But insurance resources did regularly list mental health issues or sexually-transmitted illnesses as pre-existing conditions.",
      "For example, if a person were pricked with a used needle or had consensual sex with someone they later discovered had HIV, that person might also take HIV preventatives. And because they took that medication, they, like some sexual assault victims, might have trouble buying health insurance on the open market.",
      "If a sexual assault victim chose not to seek medical treatment, he or she wouldn't necessarily face the same challenge in getting insurance.",
      "\"This is not something specific about sexual assault,\" said Urban Institute senior fellow Linda Blumberg. \"But to the extent victims of sexual assault are needing to take this (HIV) medication, they're very vulnerable in terms of getting insurance coverage in the future.\"",
      "What repealing the Affordable Care Act could mean",
      "The Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent authority on health policy, recently wrote policy papers about pre-existing conditions prior to the Affordable Care Act and how repealing the law would affect women. Neither of those two articles say sexual assault victims would face a particular challenge.",
      "The Republicans' bill doesn't change what is or is not a pre-existing condition.",
      "What it does is allow more consideration of pre-existing conditions than is permitted under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "\"The bill just leaves it to the imagination at this point,\" Blumberg said, referring to what insurance companies might consider as a pre-existing condition.",
      "To be clear, the bill doesn't allow insurance providers to deny coverage to someone based on pre-existing conditions outright. But with a waiver, states can allow providers to set premium costs based on an individual's \"health status.\" Even though the bill puts in some protections, health economists say this could make insurance unaffordable for those with pre-existing conditions.",
      "Before the Affordable Care Act, health insurance companies were not transparent about what counts as a pre-existing condition, and the House Republican replacement doesn't change that, said Kathryn Votava, president of health care consulting company Goodcare.",
      "This allows for the real possibility that sexual assault victims who seek medical treatment could face challenges in getting health insurance if the Republican bill becomes law, she said.",
      "\"Could\" is the key word.",
      "What ultimately happens depends on whether the bill is changed in the Senate and how states and insurance companies respond.",
      "The lack of transparency, as well as the potential for different policies from state to state, would put a significant burden on consumers trying to figure out whether they can obtain insurance given their health status, said Claire Brindis, director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California San Francisco.",
      "For victims of sexual assault in particular, the bill could have a chilling effect, she added. Women might choose not to seek medical treatment after an assault because they are concerned it might affect their ability to get health insurance down the line.",
      "Sexual assault \"is the tip of the iceberg,\" Brindis said. \"There are many many other examples of unexpected events that occur in day to day life, that you can't plan for, can't avoid.\"",
      "Our ruling",
      "Various bloggers wrote that under the House Republican health plan, sexual assault is a pre-existing condition.",
      "Several websites have since softened their headlines to be more careful, going from \"would\" to \"could.\"",
      "The bill does not change what is or is not a pre-existing condition; the health insurance companies write those definitions for themselves. The House bill also does not single out sexual assault or any other medical issue as a pre-existing condition.",
      "Prior to the Affordable Care Act, some victims of sexual assault said they had trouble getting health insurance because they sought medical services that the insurance companies viewed as evidence of a pre-existing condition, such as for sexually transmitted illness or mental health.",
      "The Republican bill might make it harder for people who have pre-existing conditions to get affordable health care coverage. Victims of sexual assault would face the same challenge as others with pre-existing conditions. But we don't know for sure given the bill's current form.",

      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the House-passed Republican health care bill would leave 23 million more Americans without insurance by 2026.",
      "Republicans counter that the situation with the Affordable Care Act is dire.",
      "\"Obamacare is collapsing. We must do something,\" Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said in a Facebook post May 24. \"This year, a majority of states are seeing premiums and costs double, including states that expanded Medicaid. Three states Alaska, Alabama, and our own Oklahoma are seeing premiums triple.\"",
      "A PolitiFact reader thought that sounded high, so they asked us to take a look.",
      "What we found is that Lankford inartfully described the results of a study, which by itself has significant limitations.",
      "Lankford uses problematic wording when he says that \"this year, a majority of states are seeing premiums and costs double.\"",
      "We suspect that a reasonable person would interpret those words to mean that premiums doubled from one year to the next -- an undeniably worrisome prospect, if true. But that's not correct, according to a report released May 23 by the office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at the Department of Health and Human Services. This report appears to be the one Lankford is referring to because with one crucial exception, the numbers in his post fit with those in the report.",
      "The Health and Human Services study did find that in 25 of the 39 states studied, rates doubled (or more) over the period analyzed. But the period analyzed wasn't the past year.",
      "In reality, the report compares premiums in 2013 -- a year before the Affordable Care Act took full effect -- to premiums in 2017. That's a span of four years.",
      "We should also note that the HHS comparison looked at individually purchased policies, not employer-sponsored plans. Lankford did not note that distinction.",
      "But there are bigger concerns than the time frame -- namely, that the 2013 figure and the 2017 figure aren't an apples-to-apples comparison.",
      "And what's different about the numbers tend to make the premium increases look larger, and the Affordable Care Act look worse.",
      "The 2017 figure ignores all subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "Comparing premium levels in 2013 and 2017 ignores that most policyholders in 2017 were able to obtain subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Factoring that into the HHS study would have dropped the out-of-pocket cost for 2017.",
      "The difference can be substantial. Cynthia Cox, associate director for health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation, pointed to federal data showing that in Oklahoma -- Lankford's home state -- the average plan on the marketplace cost $620 before subsidies and $79 after subsidies.",
      "In any case, the after-subsidy figure is what really matters for the consumer, not the published rate they never have to pay.",
      "The comparison doesn't take into account that, due to the Affordable Care Act, plans in 2017 covered more than plans in 2013 did.",
      "One explanation for why premiums rose between 2013 and 2017 is that the Affordable Care Act required all plans to cover certain basic services that were not mandatory previously. But comparing it the way the Health and Human Services study does doesn't indicate that the purchaser was getting added benefits for their added outlays.",
      "For instance, \"prescription drugs were often excluded from nongroup coverage pre-2013, or offered in only a very limited way,\" said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. \"People wanting drug coverage were considered high risk. Since drugs are covered under (Affordable Care Act) plans, and since prescription drug costs are the fastest growing component of health costs in recent years, this difference in coverage makes the comparison increasingly inappropriate.\"",
      "The comparison ignores the impact of the Affordable Care Act's requirement that insurers cover people with preexisting conditions.",
      "It's easier to keep down premiums if insurers are allowed to exclude the most expensive potential patients, as was the case in 2013 but not 2017.",
      "\"Pre-(Affordable Care Act) premiums were low because people with pre-existing conditions were denied coverage or charged deterrent rates, and insurer rating practices also made it more difficult for sick people to renew and maintain their coverage,\" Cox said.",
      "And, we should add, the low premiums from 2013 wouldn't have helped someone with pre-existing conditions at all.",
      "The universe of plans studied changed between 2013 and 2017.",
      "To understand this particular difference, we should first explain that individual insurance is one of the major categories of insurance -- the one in which people buy policies on their own, as opposed to getting it provided through their job or from the government (as is the case with Medicaid or Medicare).",
      "Today, some people in the individual insurance market buy their insurance on the healthcare.gov marketplaces that were set up under the Affordable Care Act. Some, however, still buy their individual plans outside of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. It's not a trivial percentage: One estimate published in the journal Health Affairs found that 40 percent of individual-market plans were sold off the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.",
      "These plans were not considered in the Health and Human Services study. In addition, the Health and Human Services study only looked at Affordable Care Act marketplaces run by the federal government, not those run by the states on their own. This matters, Cox said, because states that run their own exchanges have seen lower-than-average premium growth, in part because the customer base for their marketplaces have tended to be healthier.",
      "So, if the study had looked at state-run marketplaces, not just the federal marketplaces, the premium figure for 2017 might have been lower.",
      "Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, agreed with the critiques listed here and said that the Affordable Care Act is \"not in a death spiral or collapsing.\" Still, she added that problems with the marketplaces should not be overlooked. \"The markets are clearly still in churn. Insurance companies are still exiting and substantial premium increases being reported,\" she said.",
      "Lankford's communications director, D.J. Jordan, told PolitiFact that while \"the understanding of the phrase this year' is a nuanced technicality, the general message of the senator's social media post is accurate.\" He said the Health and Human Services study documents a significant rise in premiums. \"These increases are burdensome to thousands of Oklahomans who have contacted our office, and that shouldn't be downplayed. Also, just because subsidies are available to some Americans doesn't mean that premium increases aren't problematic for many families,\" Jordan said.",
      "Lankford said, \"This year, a majority of states are seeing premiums and costs double\" under Obamacare.",
      "A recent Health and Human Services study found that individual-market premiums in many states had doubled -- but over four years, not \"this year.\"",
      "But the comparison itself is flawed. It doesn't reflect several significant issues that would paint a different picture, including federal subsidies that lower the out-of-pocket cost, coverage requirements that provide better benefits for the insured, and the possibility that people with pre-existing conditions could buy a plan at all.",

    "body-text": [
      "In unveiling the House Republicans' tax bill, Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., touted its positive impact for a typical American family.",
      "\"With this plan, the typical family of four will save $1,182 a year on their taxes,\" Ryan said Nov. 2.",
      "This amount is more than two-thirds lower than what the White House earlier said before the details of the House proposal were hammered out -- that \"the average American family would get a $4,000 raise under the President's tax cut plan.\" We have urged skepticism about the $4,000 figure.",
      "But what about the $1,182 figure? When we took a closer look at the math, we found that it leaves out some important qualifiers.",
      "The House Ways and Means Committee calculated several scenarios for how the proposal's changes could affect different types of taxpayers.",
      "The key elements in this calculation involve tax brackets, the standard deduction and the child tax credit.",
      "Currently, there are seven brackets; these would be consolidated into four -- 12 percent (up from 10 percent today), 25 percent, 35 percent, and 39.6 percent.",
      "In the meantime, the standard deduction will be raised from $12,000 to $24,000. And the child tax credit will be increased from $1,000 to $1,600, bolstered by a new $300 credit for parents and other dependents.",
      "The example Ryan highlighted refers to a \"family of four making $59,000 per year.\" Here's the scenario outlined in the House's fact sheet, using the fictional example of \"Steve and Melinda\" with two middle school-aged children:",
      "\"As a result of lower tax rates, a significantly larger standard deduction, and an enhanced Child Tax Credit and Family Flexibility Credit, Steve and Melinda will pay over $1,182 less in taxes than last year, reducing their total tax bill from $1,582 to only $400. \"That's more money they can use for whatever is important to them, whether it's paying bills, purchasing a new refrigerator, or putting away savings for the future.\"",
      "The Ways and Means Committee, answering questions for Ryan's office, said they chose a household income of $59,000 because it's the median household income nationally.",
      "For that amount of income, a family today would get $12,700 from the standard deduction, $16,200 in personal exemptions, leaving $30,100 in taxable income. Of that, $18,650 would be taxed at 10 percent and $11,450 would be taxed at 15 percent, meaning the preliminary tax liability would be $3,582.50. That would be adjusted with $2,000 in child tax credits, producing a final tax liability of $1,582.50.",
      "Under the new tax bill, the family would take a larger $24,000 standard deduction (the proposal eliminates personal exemptions), leaving $35,000 in taxable income. At the 12 percent rate, that would mean $4,200 in preliminary liability. This would be offset by $3,200 in child tax credits and $600 in family credits, leaving a final tax liability of $400. That's a $1,182.50 tax cut.",
      "So Ryan has some mathematical detail to back up the figure. But it leaves out at least three caveats.",
      "The median household income is $59,000, but the median family income is almost $73,000: The Ways and Means Committee used the figure for median household income, but Ryan referred to the \"typical family of four.\"",
      "The major difference is that households can include one person living alone, whereas a family is a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together.",
      "So among families, a $59,000 income is not necessarily \"typical\" -- it's actually in the bottom half of the income spectrum. The last time the median family income was as low as $59,000 was in 1985.",
      "On the other hand, Ryan's office notes that if you calculate the impact the same way for a family that earns $73,000, the savings are actually higher, at $1,602.",
      "Your mileage may vary: The GOP bill eliminates or shrinks a number of widely used itemized deductions, and those factors aren't taken into account in the figure Ryan cited.",
      "The deductions eliminated or pared back in the bill include the mortgage interest deduction (for future mortgages, it would be capped at half its previous maximum); the state and local tax deduction (only $10,000 in property tax deductions would be allowed); the medical expense deduction; the casualty loss deduction; and the student loan interest deduction.",
      "Exchanging these changes for a higher standard deduction may benefit many taxpayers, particularly those who choose not to itemize today. But some taxpayers who depend on these itemized deductions today may end up worse off if the bill is passed as is, even with the higher standard deduction.",
      "For this type of taxpayer, the loss of even one of those deductions could conceivably wipe out that $1,182 gain for certain types of families.",
      "This specific amount of tax savings is good for just the first year: The benefits for this family shrink, slowly but surely, over the next decade.",
      "\"The tax cut definitely dissipates over time,\" David Kamin, a tax and budget specialist at the New York University law school, told PolitiFact.",
      "Kamin cited a combination of factors, including the sunsetting of the $300 per parent tax credit; the lack of inflation adjustments for the child tax credit, which effectively replace personal exemptions that were indexed to inflation; and the new use of an inflation adjustment measure known as chained CPI, which grows more slowly than the yardstick in current use.",
      "According to Kamin's calculations, the initial tax cut for the family making $59,000 becomes a $500 tax increase by 2024 compared to the status quo. Here's the graph he put together:",
      "Ryan said, \"With this plan, the typical family of four will save $1,182 a year on their taxes.\"",
      "This is based on a plausible and transparent calculation, but Ryan glosses over some context. The calculation doesn't factor in several itemized deductions that would disappear under the proposal and that could have a significant impact on at least some \"typical\" families around that income level. And Ryan's statement is misleading when he says the family will save \"$1,182 a year,\" since that's the case in the first year only; after that, the benefit starts to shrink and eventually turns into a tax hike.",
      "We rate the statement Half True.",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE, Nov. 3, 6:50 p.m.: This article has been updated to include additional information provided by Ryan's office about the tax impact on a family of four that makes $73,000 annually."

      "Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany wanted to highlight some good news: Trump's \"underreported\" success with small dollar donations in the 2016 presidential election.",
      "She tweeted on Oct. 11, \"Underreported fact: President @realDonaldTrump raised more in small dollar donations than Obama in 2012 and than Clinton and Bernie combined!\"",
      "We hadn't heard that, so we decided to look into it.",
      "Cassie Smedile, Republican National Committee national press secretary, said that McEnany got her information from a Washington Post article that cited a Campaign Finance Institute report.",
      "The institute used data from the Federal Elections Commission disclosure reports to analyze campaign contributions. It focused on donations from people who gave less than $200 over the course of the entire campaign to both the campaigns and the joint fundraising committees.",
      "The $200 limit comes from the FEC. A quirk in the campaign reporting process means the FEC only records each individual donor who donates more than $200, while tracking the sum of contributions of $200 or less to the campaigns.",
      "This is important to remember, because over the course of the campaign, donors could have given smaller amounts repeatedly that added up to more than $200. These donors technically gave small amounts, but they would not be captured in the institute's report because the report focused on donors who gave less than $200 total.",
      "\"I've reviewed the CFI report but I can't replicate their methodology, so I can't speak to the accuracy of the report,\" said Doug Weber, senior researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics.",
      "\"I can't match up the numbers for you, but the Campaign Finance Institute does good work,\" said Judith Ingram, press officer at the Federal Elections Commission.",
      "Here is the breakdown of how much each candidate received from small donors, according to the institute's report:",
      "Trump received about $239 million from donors who gave less than $200 in total. That amounts to 69 percent of the Trump campaign's individual contributions;",
      "Hillary Clinton received about $137 million from $200-or-under donors. That made up 22 percent of the campaign's individual contributions;",
      "Going back further, President Barack Obama received about $219 million from small-dollar donors in 2012, or 28 percent of his campaign's individual contributions. In 2008, Obama received about $181 million, or 24 percent of his total individual contributions.",
      "So, according to the Campaign Finance Institute, Trump raised $20 million more from small-dollar donors than Obama in 2012 and $2 million more than Clinton and Sanders combined in 2016.",
      "A few more details: Obama ran unopposed in the 2012 Democratic primary election. Sanders was not the Democratic party nominee in 2016 and did not run in the general election. The report only looked at Sanders' fundraising through June 30, 2016.",
      "Aspects of the campaign calendar contributed to Trump's success with under-$200 donors. Sanders, Obama and Clinton raised money over a longer period of time so that some of the small donors may have donated more than once and exceeded the $200 threshold.",
      "Trump, by contrast, raised more money in a shorter time frame. \"Because Trump raised most of his money over four months, fewer of his donors had this experience (of donating more than once). Even this caveat, however, does not negate the fact that his small donor numbers were record shattering,\" said Brendan Glavin, data and systems manager at the Campaign Finance Institute.",
      "The institute looked at not only how much each candidate received, but also how much the candidates' joint fundraising committees helped raise as well. Glavin said that the RNC and the Trump campaign made a deal and split the fundraising from committees. \"The main joint fundraising committee was the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, which raised in 2016 $263 million,\" said Glavin.",
      "Here's a breakdown of how much each campaign raised from donors who gave $200 or less, without the help of the joint fundraising committees, according to FEC reports:",
      "Trump raised $86.6 million, or 64 percent of the campaign's total individual contributions.",
      "Obama in 2012 raised $234.4 million, or 42 percent of the campaign's total individual contributions.",
      "Sanders raised $134.6 million, or 58 percent of the campaign's total individual contributions.",
      "Clinton raised $105.5 million, or 26 percent of the campaign's total individual contributions.",
      "Rick Hasen, campaign finance legal scholar at University of California Irvine School of Law said, \"This seems like a correct tweet. The only caveat is the point at the end of the report about some donors being so enthused they went over the $200 threshold.\"",
      "The Clinton campaign encouraged this enthusiasm in the fundraising emails they sent out to their supporters. This is an example of the language used in the emails: \"FEC policy is that only supporters who have contributed more than $200 are included on the record. Your support has been above average, but you're a few donations away from that threshold. Donate before Wednesday's deadline to get your support on the official record.\"",
      "McEnany said Trump \"raised more in small dollar donations\" than his Democratic competitors. Trump, in conjunction with his joint fundraising committees, did raise more money from people who donated less than $200. Because McEnany did not mention what constitutes a small donation and that the institute also was looking at contributions to joint fundraising committees, we rate this statement Mostly True.",

      "President Donald Trump said he wouldn't benefit financially from the Republican tax legislation on Capitol Hill. In fact, he said he would get socked by it.",
      "\"So right now, America's tax code is a total dysfunctional mess,\" Trump said in a speech in St. Charles, Mo., on Nov. 29, 2017. \"The current system has cost our nation millions of American jobs, trillions and trillions of dollars, and billions of hours wasted on paperwork and compliance. It is riddled with loopholes that let some special interests -- including myself, in all fairness. This is going to cost me a fortune, this thing -- believe me. Believe me, this is not good for me.\"",
      "Trump's claim sounded dubious. The analyses of the bills we have seen show advantages, not disadvantages, for the wealthy as well as corporations.",
      "When we asked the White House for additional details about how the law would hurt Trump, they cited the repeal of the state and local tax deduction, which allows taxpayers to deduct all or some of their state and local tax burden from their federal taxable income. As a wealthy resident of New York City, Trump would likely face high tax state and local rates. (At the Nov. 30 press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited the elimination of deductions as one possible source of a tax increase for the president.)",
      "The White House also cited \"anti-abuse\" provisions within the changes being made to the \"pass-through\" tax rates for business income that is taxed within individual tax filings.",
      "Trump may indeed get hit by some of the tax bill's specific provisions. But independent analyses of the bill's potential impact on his own tax situation agree that, after all is said and done, he should come out far ahead compared to the status quo.",
      "It is impossible to pin down the benefits that would flow to Trump's tax situation due to his own refusal to follow the decades-old presidential precedent of releasing his tax returns. (He broke his promise to release them).",
      "Any projections depend on a leaked, partial tax return from 12 years ago, and a lot may have changed since then. For instance, there's no way of knowing whether 2005 was an unusual year for Trump's finances.",
      "Analyses by the New York Times and NBC attempted to understand how Trump's finances would be impacted by the House bill rely on the partial 2005 return. The Times based its calculations on a framework that preceded the official release of both chambers' bills. The NBC analysis was based on the House version of the bill. (The framework is different than the House bill in its details, but they share many common elements.)",
      "The elimination of the alternative minimum tax and the lowering of the pass-through tax rate for certain types of business income -- minus tax increases from eliminating many existing deductions -- would leave Trump $42 million better off, according to the New York Times analysis. (The alternative minimum tax requires that taxpayers with many deductions pay at least a minimum amount of taxes.)",
      "The NBC analysis undertaken by Maury Cartine, the partner in charge of tax and business services in the New York City office of the Marcum Group found net savings of $22.5 million for Trump, primarily from eliminating the alternative minimum tax.",
      "Trump's myriad ventures could enable him to benefit from several changes.",
      "The House version would allow \"pass-through\" business income to be taxed at 25 percent, rather than the current maximum of 39.6 percent. The Senate bill would use a different mechanism for such income that is less advantageous.",
      "Trump's 2005 return showed more than $109 million in income from businesses that would potentially benefit from a tax break on pass-through income.",
      "So, at the very least, two independent estimates came up with immediate savings in the low tens of millions of dollars. Even if the actual savings for Trump end up being a small fraction of that amount, that would be more money than most Americans make in a year, and more than some make in a lifetime.",
      "Meanwhile, this doesn't include the potentially massive benefits Trump could see from changes to the estate tax -- albeit savings that would take longer to materialize.",
      "The estate tax comes into play when someone dies and their estate is large enough to qualify for the tax. Due to generous exemptions, the tax generally hits wealthy taxpayers.",
      "The House bill would end the estate tax after 2024. The Senate bill would keep it, instead doubling the current exemption for individuals to $11 million. The approach that prevails in the final version of the bill is unknown for now.",
      "Both the Times and NBC estimated that the House version of the estate tax could save Trump more than $1.1 billion. Neither analysis looked specifically at the Senate's version; that approach would likely provide Trump with some savings, but on a much smaller scale. (It's worth noting that any potential savings from the estate tax would come only after the death of Trump or his wife Melania, presumably years down the road.)",
      "Trump's possible gains from the bill are hardly unique for the wealthiest Americans.",
      "According to analysis of the Senate bill by the Joint Committee on Taxation, American households with incomes in excess of $1 million -- a threshold Trump is almost certainly far above -- would see a tax savings of $41,819 in 2019 and $36,259 in 2017.",
      "And an analysis by an independent group, the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, estimated that for the top one-tenth of 1 percent of earners -- those with incomes of at least $3,439,900 -- 72 percent would see tax cuts and 28 would see a tax increase in 2018. The average tax cut for this group would be $174,620 in 2018.",

      "It didn't take long for Democrats to criticize President Donald Trump's tax proposal as being biased toward wealthier Americans. But would those same tax cuts be paid for by big cuts to Medicare and Medicaid?",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said so during a Senate floor speech on Oct. 4.",
      "\"The Republicans are proposing to pay for their giant tax cut to the rich by gutting Medicare and Medicaid,\" Schumer said. \"That's the bombshell this week. That is the nugget that will destroy their whole plan, because Americans are so against those kinds of cuts.\"",
      "In reality, the linkage between the proposed tax cuts and possible cuts to Medicare is more complicated than Schumer described.",
      "Schumer's staff said the \"bombshell\" is in the Senate Republicans' budget proposal, unveiled on Sept. 29. The 89-page document would increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next decade.",
      "The Medicare and Medicaid cuts Schumer cited come from relatively hard-to-find numbers released by the Senate Budget Committee, which wrote the proposal.",
      "To determine the size of the cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, Schumer's office compared the most recent \"baseline\" spending amounts produced by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and the amounts proposed by the Senate budget document.",
      "For Medicare, Schumer's office calculated that projected spending on the program would be in excess of $8.5 trillion over the next 10 years, if no changes are made from the status quo. The GOP budget, by contrast, projects Medicare spending over the same period to be $8.1 trillion.",
      "The difference between the estimate and the GOP budget plan: almost $473 billion, or 5.5 percent of the CBO baseline.",
      "For the category that includes Medicaid, CBO produced a baseline spending level of $6.6 trillion over 10 years. In the GOP budget, the equivalent amount is $5.3 trillion over 10 years.",
      "That's a difference of $1.3 trillion. Since Medicaid is estimated to account for 80 percent of that budget line, the specific decline in Medicaid spending would be a bit under $1.1 trillion, or about 17 percent.",
      "On Medicare, the Senate Budget Committee did not quibble with Schumer's number. However, the committee argued that this is not a \"cut\" because Medicare spending will still rise over the next 10 years -- by about 82 percent over 10 years, instead of 99 percent growth over 10 years under the status quo. Here's a graph the committee produced:",
      "",
      "The committee said this slowdown is justified because CBO says that Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund -- which covers beneficiaries' stays at hospitals and other facilities -- will run out by 2025. Making smaller cuts all along would prolong the life of the trust fund and prevent bigger cuts later on, the committee argues.",
      "As for Medicaid, the committee said that the budget resolution does not reallocate savings from Medicaid to achieve tax relief. Instead, it projects economic growth spurred by the separately proposed tax overhaul will average 2.6 percent annually, helping pay for tax cuts. Also, the committee argues that widespread benefits from the tax overhaul will leave more money in Americans' pockets and reduce the need for Medicaid enrollment.",
      "We should start by noting that the budget proposal -- and especially the tax proposal -- are works in progress and could change before (or if) they are enacted.",
      "The Senate Budget Committee has a point that Medicare spending will be going up, just not as fast as it would under the status quo. It also has a point that more modest cuts sooner could stave off bigger cuts later. (Experts have often told us that it's presumptuous to assume significant economic growth impacts before they materialize.)",
      "But we don't find it unreasonable for Schumer to call cumulative reductions to Medicare and Medicaid spending in the hundreds of billions of dollars \"cuts.\" The reductions below the CBO baseline are indeed in the Senate budget document, which fits with Schumer's words that the GOP is \"proposing\" them. And an independent analysis by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center backs up the notion that the GOP's cuts are tilted toward richer Americans.",
      "That said, he's glossed over some nuance.",
      "The tax proposal is advancing on a different track than the Senate Republicans' budget plan, and both are at an early stage. So Schumer's direct linkage between specific tax cuts and Medicare-Medicaid cuts is exaggerated -- and keyed to a hot-button issue for voters.",
      "As released, the tax proposal promises to partially offset cuts by repealing other tax breaks, with the rest simply adding to the deficit. And the Senate budget resolution allows the deficit to increase by $1.5 trillion.",
      "Since money is fungible, this means that it would be at least as accurate to say that the tax cuts would be paid for by added deficits, rather than cuts to Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "In the meantime, Medicare and Medicaid cuts aren't as inevitable as Schumer suggests. The way things look now, the tax cuts, procedurally, would be easier to pass than the spending cuts.",
      "Passage of the budget would tee up a 51-vote Senate threshold for the tax proposal -- easier than the regular 60-vote threshold for Senate business. While the spending cuts could also be passed within that 51-vote bill, the current indications from GOP leaders is that this 51-vote measure would be reserved for taxes, not spending, said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that is generally considered hawkish on deficits.",
      "And if spending cuts to Medicare and Medicaid need to go through the regular 60-vote process, they would be highly unlikely to pass in the current Congress, Newton said.",
      "Schumer's office acknowledges such difficulties but adds that an existing \"pay-as-you-go\" budget law would require mandatory cuts in any case.",
      "Newton added, however, that Congress has previously waived this requirement through legislation.",
      "\"Presumably, Schumer would be interested in wiping the scorecard' and avoiding those cuts,\" Newton said.",
      "Schumer said, \"The Republicans are proposing to pay for their giant tax cut to the rich by gutting Medicare and Medicaid.\"",
      "He has a point that the tax proposal includes significant tax cuts and that the Senate Republicans' budget proposal reduces projected spending levels for Medicare and Medicaid by hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years.",
      "However, Schumer has overstated the linkage between the proposed tax and spending cuts. In addition, his decision to highlight Medicare and Medicaid cuts with the vivid word \"gutting\" leaves the impression that such reductions are a drastic reshaping and are likelier to occur than they actually are.",

      "Roy Moore, Alabama's Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate, introduced a new dimension to the debate over NFL players' protest by claiming that kneeling during the national anthem is illegal.",
      "\"It's against the law, you know that?\" Moore said in an Oct. 16 interview with Time magazine. \"It was a act of Congress that every man stand and put their hand over their heart. That's the law.\"",
      "Given his controversial role as the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, Moore's claim caught our attention. We've previously looked at the history of athletes protesting the national anthem, but this is the first time we wanted to explore what the law says and doesn't say on the matter.",
      "Moore cited Title 36, Section 301 of the U.S. Code, which designates the Star-Spangled Banner as the national anthem. It also instructs military members and veterans on how to properly comport themselves while the anthem plays, before addressing civilian etiquette.",
      "\"All other persons present should face the flag and stand at attention with their right hand over the heart,\" the law states, \"and men not in uniform, if applicable, should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart.\"",
      "So Moore is correct in one sense: Congress indeed passed a law dealing with decorum during the national anthem. But the etiquette is merely a suggestion, not a legal obligation.",
      "We know this because lawmakers used the word \"should\" not \"shall\" with regard to their patriotic guidance. The word \"should\" implies \"usually no more than an obligation of propriety,\" according to the authoritative legal reference Black's Law Dictionary. In other words, \"should\" does not create a legally enforceable duty.",
      "\"When laws are binding they use the word shall.' Shall is non-negotiable, and not discretionary,\" said Catherine Ross, a law professor at George Washington University who specializes in First Amendment law. \" Should' is a recommendation. That is, in the context of patriotic ceremonies, it's what a civilian should do if they want to follow best practices.\"",
      "Moore's statement may give the impression the law is binding, when in fact it's toothless at least with regard to non-military members. It contains no mechanism to force the average civilian to stand at attention during the national anthem, and contains no penalties for those who opt to sit or kneel.",
      "The absence of such consequences reinforces that the law is simply a protocol or ideal, as opposed to a legal mandate, said Michael Gerhardt, a professor at UNC School of Law.",
      "Because the law contains no enforcement mechanism or penalty, it's difficult to imagine a civilian who knelt for the national anthem being hauled into court. But for argument's sake we asked legal experts how a judge would handle such a case.",
      "\"In spite of whatever the law says,\" Gerhardt said, \"there is strong Supreme Court precedent protecting people from being compelled to express a message they do not approve.\"",
      "Ross said two Supreme Court cases virtually ensure a court would find that the First Amendment protects the right to kneel during the national anthem.",
      "In 1943, the court ruled in West Virginia vs. Barnette that the First Amendment protects people from being forced to participate in patriotic ceremonies that offend their conscience or beliefs. In the 1989 case of Texas vs. Johnson, the court protected the the right to burn the American flag as a form of symbolic speech.",
      "\"If the Constitution protects the right to burn the flag and the right not to participate in the pledge as aspects of free speech,\" Ross said, \"it must also protect the right to kneel respectfully during the national anthem or the pledge of allegiance.\"",
      "Moore said NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem is \"against the law.\"",
      "Moore's basis is that a law on the books describes patriotic etiquette during the national anthem.

      "While presidential speeches to the United Nations usually focus on foreign policy, President Donald Trump began his by touting domestic accomplishments on his watch.",
      "\"Fortunately, the United States has done very well since Election Day last Nov. 8,\" he said while addressing the General Assembly on Sept. 19, 2017. \"The stock market is at an all-time high, a record. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before. Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time.\"",
      "We decided to check his assertion that \"companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time.\"",
      "We found that Trump exaggerated the job growth (it's not unprecedented), but there is some truth to his point about companies moving back to the country.",
      "The most obvious way to look at this claim is to look at recent job growth rates. So we looked up month-to-month increases in jobs since 2011 -- the point at which the national economy started gaining jobs consistently after the Great Recession.",
      "The monthly gains in red -- those since Trump became president -- don't look much different from the types of gains seen under President Barack Obama starting in 2011. The highest monthly job gain under Trump -- 232,000 -- was exceeded in 28 separate months on Obama's watch.",
      "Next, we looked at the specific job gains under Trump from February 2017 to August 2017. We compared that period to the February-to-August job gains under Obama between 2011 and 2016. Here's what we found:",
      "This chart shows that the job gains under Trump were actually lower than each of the last six years of February-to-August job gains for Obama, except for one year -- 2012.",
      "This shouldn't suggest that the pace of job creation this year is a disappointment. While one would expect big job gains in the immediate aftermath of a major recession as the economy catches up, seeing substantial gains this many years after the recession officially ended is far from guaranteed.",
      "In reality, August 2017 represented the 83rd successive month of month-to-month job gains -- easily a record. The longest previous spell of positive increases in monthly payroll employment was 48, in the period ending in June 1990, said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.",
      "\"It is surprising how long (strong job growth) has continued,\" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist.",
      "At the same time, she added, \"it's also disappointing that the gain in jobs hasn't also been accompanied by strong wages and productivity growth.\"",
      "Another way of looking a Trump's statement is not in terms of record overall job growth, but specifically about jobs created by companies moving their operations to the United States.",
      "Here, he has a stronger point.",
      "A group called the Reshoring Initiative has been collecting data since 2010 on \"reshoring\" -- a combination of U.S. firms bringing jobs back to the U.S., and foreign companies deciding to locate jobs here.",
      "Publicly, the group released data in May 2017 showing that \"for the first time in decades, more manufacturing jobs are returning to the United States than are going offshore.\" Specifically, the group found a record-high 77,000 reshored jobs in 2016, bringing the total since 2010 to 338,000.",
      "Those gains, of course, took place under Barack Obama. But while the group hasn't officially published data covering the period since Trump took office, we asked the group for their latest data, covering Trump's time in office.",
      "According to the group, reshoring started going up substantially beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 and has accelerated in 2017.",
      "Between 2013 and 2015, the average number of reshored jobs announced per quarter was about 17,000, Harry C. Moser, the Kildeer, Ill., group's founder and president, told PolitiFact. Then, during the first three quarters of 2016, that number fell to an average of 12,000.",
      "Then it picked up. In the fourth quarter of 2016, it almost doubled to 22,000. In the first quarter of 2017, it almost doubled again to 40,000. And the preliminary number for the second quarter of 2017 is even higher, at 50,000.",
      "When we asked Moser if he had an explanation for such increases, he offered two, based on his discussions with company executives. One is a more favorable exchange rate for the U.S. dollar. The other is the expectation among businesses that Trump would cut taxes and regulation, and that he might erect tariffs or otherwise punish goods produced overseas.",
      "\"You can never be sure, but in my professional opinion, a significant portion of the increase comes from the expectation of good things (from Trump) and a fear of bad things (from him),\" Moser said.",
      "The corollary, he added, is that if Trump fails to deliver on these promises, those reshored jobs could evaporate.",
      "As we noted, these numbers haven't been publicly released. So did Trump just happen to guess correctly in this case? Maybe not. Moser said he'd sent this data to the White House \"through different channels, such as congressmen and semi-confidants, about eight times.\"",
      "So the reshoring data could have been what Trump was referring to. But the White House didn't confirm to us that this is the interpretation he'd intended.",
      "A final point. When checking statements like this, we usually note that presidential actions do not necessarily have much of an impact on job numbers, which are often driven by broader factors, such as international economic conditions and technological change.",
      "However, in this case, an independent source has indicated that Trump's promises -- rather than actual policies he delivered -- are what drove the companies to locate jobs in the United States. So for the purposes of judging this claim, it's not unreasonable to say that Trump deserves some credit.",
      "Trump said, \"Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time.\"",
      "Overall, job growth is strong, particularly this long after the recession, but the gains are not much different (and maybe a little worse) than they were during the last six years of Obama's tenure.",
      "However, there is evidence that the number of jobs specifically caused by \"companies moving back\" has increased under Trump, and one reason for this may be Trump's promises, both of the carrot and stick variety. On balance, we rate the statement Half True."

      "To date, two portions of Trump's tax returns have been leaked to the media. One consists of summary pages from state tax returns from 1995, which were sent anonymously to the New York Times in 2016. However, because these are state -- not federal -- tax documents, they don't shed much light on this claim.",

      "Trump's tax plan would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, which is a calculation that guarantees that certain higher-income taxpayers with large deductions pay at least a minimum amount of tax.",
      "\"This framework substantially simplifies the tax code by repealing the existing individual AMT,\" Trump's proposal says.",
      "A line in Trump's 2005 tax return shows that Trump paid $31,261,179 that year for the AMT.",
      "That was a large portion of his total tax bill. Had it not been for the AMT, Trump would have owed only about $5.3 million in federal taxes that year.",
      "Even if that was an unusually large year for Trump's AMT liability, he is precisely the type of taxpayer the provision was designed for -- someone who is wealthy and who takes a lot of deductions. So if the AMT were to remain in place, it would likely be an ongoing tax burden for him.",
      "Trump's plan would lower to 25 percent the tax rate for \"small and family owned businesses conducted as sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations.\" Collectively, these are referred to as \"passthrough\" income.",
      "This policy would represent a reduction from the current top rate of 39.6 percent. (An earlier version of the Trump tax plan envisioned the rate going down all the way to 15 percent.)",
      "In his 2005 tax return, Trump listed more than $67 million in income from \"rental real estate, royalties, partnerships, S corporations, trusts, etc.\" Even if the proposed changes didn't affect that entire flow of income, some of it likely would, enabling Trump to keep more of it.",
      "An analysis using Trump's initial 15 percent proposal that was published by the Democratic staff of the House Ways and Means Committee said that Trump would save about $28.6 million from the reduction of this \"pass-through income\" rate. Trump's potential savings would be smaller -- though still substantial -- under the newer proposal of 25 percent.",
      "Trump's proposal also \"repeals the death tax,\" which is what many opponents call the tax officially known as the estate tax.",
      "In 2017, estates worth less than $5.49 million are exempt from taxation, according to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. Above $5.49 million, the estate is generally taxed at 40 percent.",
      "Estimates of Trump's net worth vary; in February, Forbes estimated that it was $3.5 billion. If that's in the ballpark, then under current law, Trump's estate could have to pay tax in the vicinity of $1 billion.",
      "In any case, since Trump's estate at his death would almost certainly be worth more than the exemption level of $5.49 million, he would be a good candidate to owe some amount of estate tax, even if it's not as high as $1 billion.",
      "Unlike the proposed changes to the alternative minimum tax and the taxation of \"passthrough\" income, the elimination of the estate tax would not be a change that Trump or his heirs could take advantage of immediately.",

With all of the money they make from the U.S., hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours, at least until Congress changes our immigration laws!\" Trump tweeted on April 2.",
      "Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA...They have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic. With all of the money they make from the U.S., hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours, at least until Congress changes our immigration laws!",
      "We decided to take a closer look at Trump's comparison of the countries' immigration policies. Is Mexico really more strict about who it admits?",
      "The White House held up an article published in the conservative-leaning Washington Times in 2010 as support for Trump's statement.",
      "Among other points, the article said that Mexican law since 2000 \"mandates that federal, local and municipal police cooperate with federal immigration authorities in that country in the arrests of illegal immigrants.\"",
      "The article outlines steep felony penalties for violations and says Mexico can use the law to kick out foreigners for a variety of reasons, including a lack of financial self-support.",
      "There's a problem with citing this nearly eight-year-old article, however: The 2000 law has largely been superseded by a law enacted in 2011.",
      "Notably, the 2011 measure decriminalized the act of entering the country without documentation and allowed undocumented immigrants to use education and health services. It also set criminal penalties for abuse of migrants by immigration agents.",
      "The 2011 law stemmed from two impulses, said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a group that generally opposes a hard-line approach to immigration.",
      "\"They wanted to create a law that respected immigrants and cleaned up human-rights violations,\" Selee said. \"They also didn't want to embarrass themselves with the United States. Mexican human-rights advocates would beat them over the head for the punitive aspects of the old law, while also enabling enforcement capabilities. It was a delicate balance.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the article's point about requiring local Mexican jurisdictions to cooperate with the federal government is a red herring for the United States, said David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. \"The requirement for states and localities to cooperate is neither here nor there, because the U.S. system of federalism prevents any such law from existing,\" Bier said.",
      "Immigration policy specialists added that there's a difference between the Mexican laws on the books and enforcement of those laws.",
      "\"As anywhere, individuals who are caught without proper authorization in Mexico will be deported from the country,\" said Sonja Wolf, a researcher with the Drug Policy Program at the Centro de Investigaci n y Docencia Econ micas (CIDE), a think tank in Aguascalientes, Mexico. \"The question is to what extent the authorities have the capacity and the will to implement the legal requirements.\"",
      "One point bolstering Trump's position is that Mexico does allow a much lower rate of immigration as a percentage of its population than the United States does. In that sense, Trump has a point that the United States is broadly more open to immigration than Mexico.",
      "But most of the additional evidence weakens Trump's argument in the tweet.",
      "For starters, it's important to remember that the enforcement mechanism of U.S. immigration laws is robust and has become more so in recent years.",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol \"has 19,000 officers with a budget of $3.8 billion,\" said Douglas S. Massey, a professor of public policy and sociology at Princeton University who specializes in immigration between the United States and Mexico. \"It is the most controlled and hardened border anywhere in the world with the exception of Korea's DMZ.\"",
      "Since the late 2000s, increases in Border Patrol resources have combined with a tougher protocol for handling incoming migrants, including more deportation proceedings and incarceration.",
      "\"Based on the previous 20 years' experience, we would have expected increased apprehensions of Mexicans after 2009 as the U.S. economy improved and unemployment plummeted,\" said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at the Pew Research Center. \"Instead, apprehensions of Mexicans continued to decline.\"",
      "The United States removed more than 3 million non-citizens from the United States between 2008 and 2016.",
      "\"Immigration crimes are still the No. 1 reason for a federal criminal arrest in the United States,\" Bier said.",
      "Another important point: In recent years, Central Americans have accounted for a growing share of migrants coming into Mexico, due to deteriorating conditions in countries such as El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.",
      "While Mexico has taken a variety of measures to limit illegal immigration and asylum for Central Americans, specialists have deemed efforts on Mexico's southern border to be largely unsuccessful.",
      "\"Mexico's borders are quite porous,\" said Wolf of the Mexican think tank. \"There are many areas where people and goods can pass through fairly easily, and there is little that the migration authorities or the security forces could do about that.\"",
      "A final note: In recent years, the United States and Mexico have significantly increased their cooperation on cross-border issues, such as drug trafficking and terrorism.",
      "This cooperation deepened due to the Merida Initiative during the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, \"and, at least up until now, it has continued through the Trump administration,\" said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Wilson Center's Mexico Institute.",

      "\"Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon,\" Trump tweeted. \"THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed. Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!\"",

      "Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed. Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!",
      "",
      "We addressed the closing of retailers across the country in another Amazon-USPS tweet-inspired story last week. (Trump had a point.) But for this fact-check, we wondered whether Amazon is causing the Postal Service to \"lose a fortune.\"",
      "The post office is losing a fortune, but Trump is wrong to blame Amazon.",
      "The Postal Service reported a net loss of $2.7 billion for 2017. It has lost $65.1 billion since 2007. Much of the red ink is attributed to a 2006 law mandating that USPS pre-fund future retirees' health benefits.",
      "First-class mail, the USPS' biggest source of revenue, also continued to shrink, seeing a $1.87 billion revenue loss in fiscal year 2017.",
      "Package delivery, however, was one of the few bright spots in its latest financial statement. In 2017, parcels brought in $19.5 billion, or 28 percent of USPS' annual revenue. At $2.1 billion, packages contributed the largest revenue increase.",
      "Deals with private shippers like Amazon accounted for $7 billion of the $19.5 billion in revenue. While we know that Amazon is the biggest e-commerce player, we don't know exactly how much of the $7 billion comes from Amazon, because the details of the postal service's deals with private shippers are considered proprietary and not made public.",
      "USPS ships about 40 percent of Amazon's packages. Amazon bulk-delivers packages to a USPS distribution center, and the Postal Service brings it to your door. USPS negotiates the discounted rate for that service with Amazon, as it does all other bulk shippers.",
      "Those rates are kept under wraps. That said, we do know the Amazon deal is at least a break-even venture.",
      "That's because the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act made it illegal for USPS to price parcel delivery below its cost.",
      "\"By law our competitive package products, including those that we deliver for Amazon, must cover their costs,\" an August 2017 USPS press release said. \"Our regulator, the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC), looks carefully at this question every year and has determined that they do. The PRC has also noted that competitive products help fund the infrastructure of the Postal Service.\"",
      "In fact, the Postal Regulatory Commission gave the green light to the USPS-Amazon deal the same day Trump began tweeting about Amazon last week.",
      "Trump might have a point, however, in saying the USPS could be making more money off Amazon. For example, Citigroup found that on average, USPS was charging $1.46 below market rates for parcel delivery (not just to Amazon).",
      "Jim Sauber, chief of staff for the National Association of Letter Carriers, explained the Postal Service can offer lower prices than their private competitors because they already \"go to every house, every day.\"",
      "\"We're already going there to deliver mail and bills and advertising, so the marginal cost of delivering an extra package is not high, especially in the low-density areas,\" Sauber said.",
      "Trump tweeted, \"Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed.\"",
      "Amazon isn't causing the United States Postal Service to lose a fortune. In fact, it's contributing to its biggest growth sector, package delivery. Deals like the one with Amazon brought in $7 billion in fiscal year 2017.",
      "While we don't know the deal USPS crafted with Amazon, we know it's not losing money. A 2006 law codified profitability into law, and an independent regulatory commission that reviews their deals annually gave it a green light on March 29.",
      "That said, it's possible that the Postal Service could be charging Amazon more for package delivery and therefore get a better deal. That still doesn't mean USPS is losing a fortune.",
      "We rate this claim False."

      "\"The northern nuclear test ground of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will be dismantled to transparently guarantee the discontinuance of the nuclear test,\" the newscaster said.",
      "Kim also reiterated the promise to conduct no weapon or missile tests while talks were under way. He added that tests were no longer needed because the country had met its goal of developing its weapons capability.",
      "So far, North Korea has yet to officially commit to scrapping its nuclear program. It has left it to other countries to put that possibility on the table.",
      "Most recently, South Korean President Moon Jae-in told dozens of South Korean media executives April 20 that North Korea was \"expressing its commitment to complete denuclearization.\"",
      "Moon said North Korea is not demanding the withdrawal of American troops from bases in South Korea. That would be a significant shift, but as the Korean newspaper Dong-a Ilbo reported along with Moon's comments, \"there is still a considerable gap between Washington's demand of the North's denuclearization in a minimum period of time and Pyongyang's calls for progressive and synchronous measures for denuclearization.\"",
      "Denuclearization has been in the air since Kim made a rare trip to Beijing to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The official Chinese news service Xinhua reported March 28 that Kim said, \"It is our consistent stand to be committed to denuclearization on the peninsula.\"",

      "In the nuances of diplomacy, the transition from \"seeking\" to \"agrees to\" is a big deal.",
      "\"North Korea has agreed to talk about it (denuclearization), not to do it,\" said Frank Jannuzi, president of the Mansfield Foundation, a group that funds work on U.S.-Asian policy.",
      "Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton sounded unimpressed with what North Korea has promised so far, even with the closure of its test site.",
      "\"I think this announcement on Friday is better than continued testing, but it's not much better than that,\" Cotton said on CBS's Face the Nation April 22. \"It's an easily reversible decision, and they made no announcement about their medium- or short- range ballistic missiles that threaten hundreds of thousands of Americans in Korea and Japan just like it threatens our allies there.\"",
      "South Korean skeptics of the North's intentions have noted that denuclearization has been central in previous high-level negotiations without producing tangible results.",

      "The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, reviewed this cash transfer in a 2018 report. It gave a total of $1.7 billion.",
      "That was the amount that U.S. and Iranian negotiators settled on to resolve an arms contract between the United States and Iran that predated the Iranian revolution in 1979. Iran had paid for military equipment, and it was never delivered.",
      "As of 1990, there were $400 million in that account. Negotiators agreed that accrued interest would add $1.3 billion to the amount, which is a lot of money but 25 years is a long time for interest to build up the balance.",

      "Trump exaggerated crowd sizes before, so we wondered whether ratings backed up his latest boast. His claim about Fox News holds up, but not so much for total State of the Union viewership.",
      "The Nielsen Company, the primary collector of television ratings data, indeed reported that 45.6 million Americans above the age of 2 tuned into the president's address across 12 networks between 9 and 10:30 p.m.",
      "That wasn't a record, though. Trump came in sixth in total State of the Union viewers since Nielsen began collecting the data in 1993. George W. Bush garnered 62 million viewers in 2003; Bill Clinton 53 million in 1998; W. Bush 51.8 million in 2002; Obama 48 million in 2010; and Clinton 45.8 million in 1994.",

      "When we asked about the \"highest number in history,\" the White House said Trump had been talking about cable news history. That works only if we exclude Trump's Joint Address to Congress in 2017 and only include the three major cable networks (CNN, Fox News Network and MSNBC) dating back to 2001, when all three aired the address. Nielsen does not track State of the Union viewership from cable and broadcast networks separately, so we tallied up ratings for the major networks across the years.",
      "That wasn't clear in the tweet, however, as the 45.6 million people encompassed watchers of both cable and broadcast networks.",
      "Fox News had an average of 11.5 million viewers between 9 and 10:30 p.m., according to Nielsen. Using the same data set, Fox reported 11.7 million viewers between 9:15 to 10:30 p.m. (The speech ran from 9:09 to 10:30 p.m.)",
      "That was a record high for Fox News during a State of the Union speech. It came in second for a presidential address to Congress only to Trump's Address to the Joint Sessions of Congress last year.",
      "Fox indeed beat out the other major networks, as Trump claimed. CNN raked in 3.1 million viewers and MSNBC had 2.7 million viewers during the State of the Union. ABC delivered 5.4 million viewers, NBC 7.1 million, CBS 7 million and FOX 3.6 million, according to Nielsen.",
      "If, as the White House explained, Trump was talking only about cable news networks, that wasn't the first time Fox News beat out the other cable networks during a State of the Union address. While the time stamps vary slightly for each network, Fox beat out CNN and MSNBC every year according to Nielsen, save for 2016.",

      "I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts. Total Fake News!",
      "The tweet immediately drew guffaws among media commentators and on social media, who quickly plucked examples of Trump downplaying evidence of a far-reaching effort by Russia to meddle in the election. (Just a day earlier, we gave Trump a Pants on Fire for tweeting that he \"never said Russia did not meddle in the election.\")",
      "When we looked at the past decade of U.S.-Russia policy, however, we found a more nuanced picture. Tougher government policies implemented under President Barack Obama have largely continued under Trump, even though they were often overshadowed and perhaps undercut by Trump's friendly remarks and tweets toward Russia and President Vladimir Putin.",
      "The consensus among experts is that Obama was more forceful than Trump has been to date on countering election meddling.",
      "\"The key difference from Obama was (Trump's) unwillingness to take the meddling issue head on,\" said Stephen Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "As we've noted in previous fact-checks, the Obama administration took actions before and after Election Day. Prior to the election, the Obama administration publicly named the Russian government as the culprit, confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin in person, and worked to secure U.S. election infrastructure all while intelligence agencies investigated the issue.",
      "But the Obama administration's most significant retaliatory measure against Russia came after Trump's electoral win.",
      "On Dec. 29, 2016, Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats and suspected intelligence agents to leave the United States, and he also imposed narrow sanctions on some Russian individuals and organizations.",
      "Trump, on the other hand, has cast doubt on Russia's election meddling and repeated Putin's denials of his government's involvement.",
      "\"The Trump administration has repeatedly tried to undermine the credibility of the FBI and intelligence agencies in their investigation and assessment of the threat to the integrity of U.S. elections by Russian operatives,\" said Yoshiko Herrera, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.",
      "Herrera added that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is looking into whether the Trump administration crossed the line into obstruction of justice by trying to impede the investigation of the Russian threat to the American electoral system.",
      "While some experts noted that Trump signed a law calling for new sanctions against Russia in response to its interference with the election, they added that the legislation was hardly the product of Trump's hardline advocacy. Congress largely passed the bill with veto-proof majorities in response to Trump's downplaying of the meddling question and his seeming interest in lifting sanctions against Russia, Sestanovich said.",
      "When it came time to sign the bill into law in August, Trump did so grudgingly. He expressed significant reservations, saying it was \"seriously flawed\" because it usurped the executive branch's negotiating authority.",
      "Matthew Kroenig, an associate professor in the Department of Government and School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, said Trump had a point with his reservations about the legislative package, noting that the Obama administration made similar arguments that congressional sanctions against Iran infringed on the executive's authority to set foreign policy.",
      "Several experts said the White House has been hesitant to implement the sanctions. Sestanovich characterized its implementation as \"slow and half-hearted.\" In late January, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers the administration would apply sanctions to a new list of Russian oligarchs and senior government officials.",
      "\"The Trump administration didn't provide the list of who they apply to until very late,\" Herrera said. \"That's a clear sign of foot-dragging by the White House.\"",
      "Susanne Wengle, a political science professor at the University of Notre Dame, agreed that Trump \"has not been proactive or voiced strong opposition to Russian involvement in U.S. politics,\" while Obama did.",
      "However, she noted that the Trump administration has not gone so far as to reverse Obama-era laws and regulations, including the Magnitsky Act, which targeted high-ranking Russians with sanctions.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin listens to President Barack Obama in Hangzhou, China on Sept. 5, 2016. (Alexei Druzhinin/Sputnik, Kremlin Pool via AP)",
      "The White House provided some examples of policies broader than the reaction to election meddling. Judging the tweet based on the administration's geopolitical policies makes the analysis a bit more complicated.",
      "There's a crucial dividing line for U.S. policy toward Russia early 2014, when Russia annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Before that, the United States sought common ground with Russia. After that, Russia was seen in a more adversarial way.",
      "During the early years of Obama's presidency, and especially during the Russian presidential interregnum of Dmitry Medvedev, the United States sought a \"reset\" with Russia and managed to hammer out several accomplishments, including a nuclear-arms deal.",
      "\"Obama's first national security strategy only mentioned Russia as a potential partner, never as a possible threat,\" Kroenig said. \"He promised in the famous hot mic' episode that he would have flexibility' to make concessions on missile defense after the (2012) election. He refused to intervene in Syria in part because his team feared direct conflict with Russia. He refused to provide lethal aid to Ukraine fearing escalation with Russia. And he did not develop a serious strategy to deter the threat of Russian nuclear de-escalation' strikes.\"",
      "However, an increase in conflict between the two countries, heightened by the return of Putin to the presidency in 2012, prompted skepticism about whether a genuine reset was feasible. Ultimately, the reset died out entirely after the Crimean annexation in 2014.",
      "In a very narrow sense, Trump has a case. \"If you compare current 2018 U.S. policy to U.S. policy during Obama's first term, then the U.S. is clearly tougher' on Russia now,\" said Dan Nexon, an associate professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University.",
      "After 2014, however, Obama's Russia policy stiffened considerably.",
      "These included a rapid set of sanctions on people and enterprises in March 2014 following the Crimean annexation, and sector-based sanctions on Russia in July 2014 following continued Russian military activities in eastern Ukraine, said Anders slund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.",
      "Later, Obama's actions included the expulsion of Russian diplomats in December 2016, the closing of Russian compounds, and a variety of statements critical of Russia and Putin.",
      "Trump's rhetoric has consistently indicated warmth and trust toward Russia and Putin, and Trump has also sent mixed signals about the U.S. commitment to NATO.",
      "On the other hand, post-2014 U.S. policy aimed at Russia has chugged forward in important ways since Trump became president despite his rhetoric.",
      "\"The rest of the executive branch and Congress have actually taken a few tough stands against Russia during the last year,\" said Susan H. Allen, director of the Center for Peacemaking Practice at George Mason University's School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution.",
      "Among them, Kroening said, are a boost in funding for the European Reassurance Initiative, a security program that began under Obama; the development of new, low-yield nuclear capabilities to deter Russian nuclear attack; upgrades for missile defenses; and an approval of Montenegro's bid to join NATO, which had been in the works for years. The Trump administration also slapped new sanctions on five Russians and Chechens over human rights abuses.",
      "Trump's two highest-profile acts challenging Russia were his cruise missile attack against Syria's Bashar al-Assad, a Russian ally, and his approval of lethal arms sales to Ukraine. In both of those cases, Trump went further than Obama did, though it remains to be seen how thoroughly the administration will follow through on both developments.",
      "To the extent that Trump's policies against Russia have met or exceeded Obama's post-2014 policies, the credit goes more to his agencies and Congress, experts said. These policies are ones that \"hawkish military types in his orbit like, and were not likely from his own initiative,\" said Wengle, the University of Notre Dame professor.",
      "Trump said, \"I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts. Total Fake News!\"",
      "There's broad agreement that on election meddling, Obama's actions while arguably insufficient to the threat at hand were stronger than Trump's. On a broader geopolitical level, there has been a significant degree of consistency between the Obama and Trump administrations in actual U.S. policy, and even a few examples where Trump has gone further than Obama did. That said, Trump's own record of Russia- and Putin-friendly comments have sent contrary messages about U.S. policy toward Russia.",

      "After a teenage gunman killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla., Americans of all political persuasions flocked to social media to express their views on gun policy.",
      "On the pro-gun control side of the argument, Areva Martin, an author and TV commentator, tweeted a graphic that showed in most of the country, it is harder to vote than it is to buy an assault rifle.",
      "She shared the following graphic with the comment, \"Just let this sink in! #FloridaSchoolShooting #Florida #GunReformNow.\"",
      "Just let this sink in! #FloridaSchoolShooting #Florida #GunReformNow pic.twitter.com/h5EvrgDwsY",
      "However, a closer look at both gun policy and election law suggest some important caveats that the graphic leaves out. (Martin did not reply to an inquiry from her representative.)",
      "Unlike many viral images we see, this one provided its sourcing.",
      "It cited an article by Alex Seitz-Wald in Salon.com and the liberal Center for American Progress. The chart was put together from elements of the Salon article by Adam Peck, an editor with the website ThinkProgress, which is affiliated with the Center for American Progress. Peck told PolitiFact that the graphic was originally created to be embedded in a separate Think Progress article.",
      "The accompanying ThinkProgress article \"was our opportunity to provide readers with the kind of information and nuance that simply don't work in a visual capacity,\" Peck said. \"Obviously, the pitfall is that those graphics can be easily divorced from their companion articles, losing whatever nuance we set out to provide.\"",
      "Also important to note: The Salon article, the ThinkProgress article and the graphic were all published in 2013. (Seitz-Wald has been at NBC News since 2014.)",
      "So the underlying data is five years old.",
      "The meme's re-emergence means there's been a game of telephone, with notable context falling by the wayside.",
      "Student survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School gather at the capitol in Tallahassee, Fla., on Feb. 21, 2018. (AP/Mark Wallheiser)",
      "You wouldn't know it from the graphic, but whether an ID is required for a gun sale depends on who is making the sale.",
      "Under federal law, federally licensed gun dealers, importers and manufacturers must run background checks for sales to an unlicensed buyer. Specifically, a potential purchaser must show identification, complete a federal document known as a Form 4473, and pass a National Instant Criminal Background Check System check.",
      "Where the meme has a point is that in the states that didn't pass a tougher law, unlicensed private sellers are exempted from having to complete the background check process. Commonly, such unlicensed sellers operate from gun shows or flea markets, although a licensed dealer selling from a show would have to run the background check.",
      "\"For anyone who thinks he or she might not pass a background check, or is looking to circumvent any waiting period, they can bypass both in a majority of states,\" said Peck, the graphic's creator.",
      "As Seitz-Wald noted in his article, states can add their own restrictions on top of these requirements. At the time the article was written, only about a third had done so. Since then, Oregon and Washington have begun requiring background checks (and thus an ID) on all gun sales, including private transfers.",
      "This distinction between the rules for licensed sellers and for unlicensed sellers didn't make it into the meme.",
      "That matters. While it is possible in many states to buy a firearm without an ID by seeking out an unlicensed seller, such purchases account for a fraction of all sales. Gun shops and other types of brick-and-mortar stores where background checks are required account for a majority of purchases.",
      "A research paper published last year in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that of the 70 percent of gun transfers studied that were purchases as opposed to gifts and inheritances 53 percent were purchased from stores and 17 percent were purchased from family, friends, online or gun shows. Those percentages have increased over time. In the past two years, 64 percent were purchased at stores.",
      "In other words, it's certainly possible to purchase a gun without an ID in many states, but in reality, a large majority of purchases are done with IDs and background checks.",
      "The graphic is more problematic on the point that in no state can you vote without proof of ID.",
      "It's certainly true that a number of states have requirements for voters to hand over a government-issued photo ID in one of just a few categories, such as driver's licenses. The strictest of these include Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Other states also have ID requirements to vote, but in many cases, they allow easier-to-obtain paperwork, including documents without a photograph in some cases. Some of the valid documents, depending on the state, include student ID cards, utility bills, bank statements, paychecks, government checks, Medicare or Medicaid cards, employer ID cards, or a bank or debit card.",
      "Finally, there are 16 states that do not currently require documents at polling booths at all. They are California, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wyoming.",
      "So the notion that every state requires an ID to vote is incorrect.",
      "If the graphic had said that an ID is required to register to vote, it would have been somewhat more accurate. Under the federal Help America Vote Act, every state must request identification when registering first-time voters who did not register in person and did not provide identification when filling out the mail-in registration form. For these voters, a wide variety of documents are accepted for registration; many states allow some of the non-photo IDs cited above to serve that purpose.",
      "The viral image said that in most states, you can buy an assault rifle with no proof of ID, but in every state, you need proof of ID to vote.",
      "It is indeed possible to buy an assault rifle without an ID if you go to a gun show but the graphic neglects to mention that these sales are the exception rather than the rule. A significant majority of gun purchases are made in transactions that require ID and a background check.",
      "As for the voting claim, some states have imposed strict photo ID laws at the voting booth. However, the graphic ignores that about one-third of states require no ID at all to vote, and that many of those that do require identification allow a range of documents to serve that purpose, including student IDs, utility bills and debit cards.",

      "Just about a week after the deadly shooting at a Florida high school, the National Rifle Association's vice president Wayne LaPierre delivered the group's response: more armed guards in schools.",
      "\"Our banks, our airports, our NBA games, our NFL games, our office buildings, our movie stars, our politicians they are all more protected than our children at school,\" Lapierre said at the Conservative Political Action Committee Feb. 22. \"To stop a bad guy with a gun, it takes a good guy with a gun.\"",

      "The group quoted LaPierre as saying in 1999, \"We believe in absolutely gun-free, zero-tolerance, totally safe schools.That means no guns in America's schools. Period.\"",
      "There are a few angles to consider here.",
      "Did LaPierre say those words?",
      "Yes, he did. It was May 1, 1999, 10 days after two teenage boys killed 13 people, wounded more than 20 others and then committed suicide at Columbine High School in Colorado. LaPierre spoke at the NRA's annual convention and called for a policy banning guns from school.",
      "But LaPierre said more than what the Everytown group quoted.",
      "He was talking about guns brought to school by students, not teachers or trained security.",
      "\"Of the 6,000 young people the president acknowledges were caught with a gun at school during the past two years, we believe all of them should have been prosecuted,\" LaPierre said. \"But the truth is only five were prosecuted in 1997. And just eight were prosecuted in 1988. That's not zero tolerance.\"",
      "LaPierre made a passing reference to armed guards in schools, referring to \"the rare exception of law enforcement officers or trained security personnel.\" As for arming teachers, something President Donald Trump has shown a keen interest in, LaPierre said nothing.",
      "In his 1999 speech, his emphasis was on what adults should do to keep weapons out of the hands of teens. LaPierre said the NRA held adults responsible.",
      "\"Just as every kid should have a guardian who knows where he is and keeps him safe, every firearm should have a guardian who knows where it is and keeps it safely stored,\" LaPierre said.",
      "Columbine horrified the nation in its scale and the cold-blooded method of the high school seniors who had spent a year planning their attack. The Senate passed a bill to strengthen background checks, but it died in the House. The slaughter prompted more discussion of early identification of loners, and more emphasis on school security. Keeping weapons out of the hands of minors gained more attention.",
      "The 2012 shootings in Newtown, Conn., that took the lives of 26 elementary students and one of their teachers was the signature event when LaPierre spoke forcefully about a good guy with a gun being the best response to a bad guy with a gun.",
      "His rhetoric in 2012 was the same as when he spoke in 2018.",
      "\"American airports, office buildings, power plants, courthouses, even sports stadiums are all protected by armed security,\" LaPierre said at a news conference Dec. 21, 2012. \"Yet, when it comes to our most beloved, innocent, and vulnerable members of the American family, our children, we as a society leave them every day utterly defenseless.\"",
      "In 2012, LaPierre called on Congress to immediately \"appropriate whatever is necessary to put armed police officers in every single school in this nation.\"",
      "Everytown for Gun Safety tweeted the reminder that nearly two decades ago, LaPierre said, \"We believe in absolutely gun-free, zero-tolerance, totally safe schools. That means no guns in America's schools. Period.\"",
      "The quotation is accurate, but it takes LaPierre's words out of context.",
      "His full message was that adults should keep weapons out of the hands of minors and that schools and localities should act swiftly to punish any student caught bringing a firearm to school.",
      "In 1999, LaPierre also left open the door for armed security on school grounds, but that was not the focus of the policy debate at the time. That option has since risen on the NRA's agenda.",

Thus, any strike or concerted work stoppage by the public teachers of this state is illegal.

      "Morrisey's tweet was carefully worded, legal experts say.",

      "\"I know of nothing that says a teacher who strikes commits a crime,\" said West Virginia University law professor Bob Bastress. \"Participating in a strike would be no different from a teacher who feigns illness to get a day off. The conduct could expose the teacher to discipline.\"",
      "Howard Seufer Jr., an attorney in Charleston, agreed. \"Strikes by public employees are not crimes in our state,\" he said. \"But public employees do not enjoy a right under our laws to strike.\"",
      "On another linguistic note, Seufer pointed out that the 1990 state Supreme Court ruling specifically noted that it was using the terms \"strike\" and \"work stoppage\" interchangably. That aligns with a 1965 opinion by the same court, which \"suggested that a strike' refers to the actions of employees that may result in such a work stoppage,\" Seufer said.",
      "If it sounds unusual for a union to be unable to strike, that's the case in West Virginia.",
      "Unions in West Virginia, including the WVEA, \"exist as voluntary associations that lobby on behalf of their members and provide them with certain services, such as representation in grievance and disciplinary proceedings,\" Seufer said. \"But our laws do not treat these associations as unions in the same sense other states do.\"",
      "Specifically, West Virginia law does not recognize a right for public school employees to collectively bargain, he said. Rather, the legislature regulates public school labor by statute.",
      "Bastress said that common law applies on the issue of strikes, \"and there is no right to strike in common law.\"",

      "President Donald Trump is closing the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, a panel to investigate voter fraud that had attracted controversy during its short life.",
      "The commission -- headed by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach -- had been \"bedeviled by internal dissension, threats of litigation and the refusal of some states to provide information. Its last known meeting was Sept. 12,\" NBC reported.",
      "The panel included a few Democrats, but its membership was majority Republican. One Democratic member of the commission even filed a lawsuit, demanding to be kept abreast of its activities. Separately, the Government Accountability Office, a federal agency, announced in October 2017 that it would probe its handling of voter files and other issues, in response to calls by Democratic lawmakers.",
      "In a statement on Jan. 3, 2018, announcing his decision to disband the commission, Trump said, \"Despite substantial evidence of voter fraud, many states have refused to provide the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity with basic information relevant to its inquiry. Rather than engage in endless legal battles at taxpayer expense, today I signed an executive order to dissolve the Commission, and have asked the Department of Homeland Security to review these issues and determine next courses of action.\"",
      "PolitiFact is separately checking a different assertion by Trump, that \"mostly Democrat states refused to hand over data\" to the commission. In this fact-check, we're looking at whether Trump is correct that there is \"substantial evidence of voter fraud.\"",
      "This is hardly the first time Trump has made an assertion of this sort. He has repeatedly claimed the existence of massive voter fraud and election rigging, which we've debunked again and again and again and again and again and again and again.",
      "Trump has not yet produced any evidence that supports these claims, and the White House did not respond to another request for this article.",
      "The White House's previous argument",
      "In a press briefing on Jan. 24, 2017, a reporter asked his then-press secretary Sean Spicer how Trump came to believe that it's possible that illegal votes were to blame for his popular vote loss.",
      "\"I think there's been studies,\" Spicer responded. \"There's one that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens. There's other studies that have been presented to him. It's a belief he maintains.\"",
      "We determined that Spicer was conflating a couple different studies, and that those studies have been erroneously used to prop up claims that noncitizens have swayed elections by voting illegally.",
      "There is no study that shows 14 percent of the votes cast in 2008 were cast by noncitizens. That would have added up to more than 18 million fraudulent votes an implausible assertion, considering the total noncitizen population was about 22.5 million in 2010.",
      "As for the study that \"came out of Pew in 2008,\" it actually came out in 2012, and it's about outdated voter rolls -- not fraudulent votes.",
      "The 2012 Pew study -- found that about 24 million, or one in every eight, voter registrations in the United States are inaccurate or no longer valid, but it did not find evidence of actual voter fraud. The study was about record-keeping that is badly managed and in disarray.",
      "David Becker, the former director of Pew's election program, tweeted in November 2016 that \"we found millions of out of date registration records due to people moving or dying, but found no evidence that voter fraud resulted.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the study that shows that \"14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens\" has been widely criticized for its methodology.",
      "Many credible researchers have panned the study as methodologically unsound for using an opt-in Internet poll originally designed to survey citizens and not considering possible survey response error.",
      "In a blog post, one of the authors, Old Dominion professor Jesse Richman, said he stands by his study, but \"our results suggest that almost all elections in the U.S. are not determined by noncitizen participation, with occasional and very rare potential exceptions.\"",
      "Voter fraud uncommon",
      "Other research suggests that voter fraud is not widespread.",
      "News21, a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found just 56 cases of noncitizens voting between 2000 and 2011.",
      "A report by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law found that most cases of noncitizens voting were accidental. \"Although there are a few recorded examples in which noncitizens have apparently registered or voted, investigators have concluded that they were likely not aware that doing so was improper,\" reads the 2007 report.",
      "In 2012, Florida Gov. Rick Scott's administration tried to crack down on noncitizens voting by comparing driver's license data against voter rolls. The Florida Department of State created a list of 182,000 potential noncitizens that had voted. That number was whittled down to 2,700, then to about 200 before the purge was stopped amid criticism that the data was flawed given the number of false positives including a Brooklyn-born World War II vet. Ultimately, only 85 people were removed from the rolls.",
      "Meanwhile, ProPublica, an investigative journalism project, tweeted that \"we had 1,100 people monitoring the vote on Election Day. We saw no evidence the election was rigged' \" and \"no evidence that undocumented immigrants voted illegally.\"",
      "Expert opinion",
      "In our previous articles on this topic, numerous election experts dismissed assertions like those made by Trump. Asked again for this article, experts agreed that nothing new had emerged as a result of the commission's work.",
      "Trump's claim \"is not accurate at all,\" said Rick Hasen, a University of California-Irvine law professor who specializes in election law. \"There has been no proof of substantial voter fraud in the 2016 election. We have seen really just a smattering of isolated cases.\"",
      "Lorraine Minnite, a Rutgers University political scientist and author of The Myth of Voter Fraud, said that her efforts to track the issue since 2001, including as an expert witness, has enabled her to study election processes up close in such states as Wisconsin, Texas, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia and Kansas.",
      "Her conclusion? \"I am not aware of any evidence of substantial voter fraud ever being offered or presented to state legislatures adopting voter ID laws, or in any of the litigation in which states, as defendants, have brought forth such evidence to defend why they adopted the laws,\" Minnite said.",

      "",
      "We decided to dissect Trump's tweet by sifting through what's known about Wolff's White House access. We can't know everything that goes on behind the scenes, but even the public record shows that Trump's statement is inaccurate.",
      "Trump's tweet could give the impression that Wolff was denied access to the White House entirely. But as Trump's own press secretary has acknowledged, the author had more than a dozen interactions with administration officials at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.",
      "Wolff claims that over an 18-month period, he conducted more than 200 interviews with Trump and senior staff. In the course of reporting his book, Wolff said he was able to take up \"something like a semi-permanent seat on a couch in the West Wing.\"",
      "Trump never explicitly allowed his visits nor barred him from the White House, Wolff said, which allowed Wolff to exploit this \"non-disapproval\" to gain access through \"various senior staffers.\" Here's the author's account of his access, as written in the Hollywood Reporter (the circumstances of which we could not independently verify):",
      "\"Since the new White House was often uncertain about what the president meant or did not mean in any given utterance, his non-disapproval became a kind of passport for me to hang around checking in each week at the Hay-Adams hotel, making appointments with various senior staffers who put my name in the system,' and then wandering across the street to the White House and plunking myself down, day after day, on a West Wing couch.\"",
      "As excerpts of Wolff's book began to circulate, journalists were eager to have the White House weigh in on the incendiary headlines.",
      "During a White House press briefing, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders faced questions about Wolff's access from one journalist who recalled seeing Wolff in the building multiple times. Here's their Jan. 3 exchange:",
      "Margaret Brennan, CBS News: \"Sarah, can you clarify? Because many of us here have seen Michael Wolff at the White House on multiple occasions. We've seen him first-hand. So we know he was here. Who gave him access to the White House? What was he here for? Can you explain any of that since we don't have access to the logs?\"",
      "Sanders: \"Yeah. So far, from what I can tell of the roughly just over a dozen interactions that he had with officials at the White House, I think close to 95 percent were all done so at the request of (former adviser) Mr. (Steve) Bannon.\"",
      "Sanders underscored that Wolff had not been given unfettered access to the White House, saying he had been denied more than 30 requests for access, including at least two dozen requests to interview the president.",
      "However, she did not dispute that Wolff had been \"seen often\" with Bannon in his White House office.",
      "\"I know there were a number of times where he met with Steve. And I think they have both said and repeated that that happened,\" she said in a Jan. 5 interview on Fox & Friends. \"We looked at the logs. We know that they met on multiple occasions. He was frequently seen meeting with him. So I think that's a pretty indisputable fact on that front.\"",
      "So, while it may be the case that Trump did not personally grant Wolff access, his own press secretary says the author had access to administration officials at the White House.",
      "To the casual reader, Trump's tweet could give the impression that he and Wolff never spoke but that's far from the case.",
      "While it may be the case that Trump never talked to Wolff with the express understanding that their discussion would later be incorporated into a book, the two men certainly spoke, though the length and nature of their conversations is not entirely clear.",
      "Wolff said he spent about three hours with Trump over the course of the campaign and at the White House.",
      "\"Whether he realized it was an interview or not, I don't know, but it certainly was not off the record,\" Wolff said in a Jan. 5 interview on NBC's Today. \"I spoke to him after the inauguration, yes. And I had spoken to, I mean I spent about three hours with the president over the course of the campaign and in the White House, so my window into Donald Trump is pretty significant.\"",
      "For her part, Sanders does not dispute that the two men spoke. According to Sanders, their only conversation since Trump became president took the form of a brief phone call, which, at that time, was not related to Wolff's book.",
      "\"There was one brief conversation that had nothing to do, originally, with the book,\" Sanders said at a Jan. 3 White House press briefing. \"It was, I think, around five to seven minutes in total since the president has taken office. And that's the only interaction that he's had.\"",

      "As a possible government shutdown loomed, President Donald Trump preemptively blamed Democrats for any negative fallout.",
      "Trump charged that Democratic intransigence about how to renew Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was preventing an agreement on federal spending that would keep the government open including the country's defense forces.",
      "\"Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety, DACA has now taken a big step backwards,\" Trump tweeted on Jan. 12, 2018. \"The Dems will threaten shutdown,' but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most. Get smart, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "....Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety, DACA has now taken a big step backwards. The Dems will threaten \"shutdown,\" but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most. Get smart, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!",
      "We won't wade into the question of who would be to blame for the shutdown. However, we wondered whether Trump was correct that a government shutdown is tantamount to \"shutting down our military.\"",
      "When we checked with the White House, they said that Trump was not using the term literally, to suggest that the entire military will cease to operate. In other tweets, Trump used less sweeping language. In one, for instance, he warned against moves that would \"stop paying our troops and government workers.\"",
      "Still, the less cautiously worded tweet attracted nearly 23,000 retweets and almost 91,000 likes, so we thought it was worth a closer look.",
      "What is a shutdown?",
      "Federal government shutdowns occur when spending bills expire, and Congress and the president find themselves at an impasse. A law known as the Antideficiency Act requires suspending a federal agency's operations until an appropriation bill is enacted. But there is some leeway to continue certain federal activities deemed essential.",
      "A two-week shutdown occurred most recently in 2013, when Barack Obama was president, Democrats controlled the Senate, and Republicans controlled the House.",
      "Prior to that, there were two shutdowns in the mid 1990s, when President Bill Clinton squared off against a new Republican majority in the House and Senate. One was for five days in November 1995, and the other was for 21 days, from December 1995 to January 1996.",
      "Who works and who doesn't",
      "During the 2013 shutdown, as many as 850,000 workers were furloughed per day, or about 40 percent of the federal workforce (not counting active-duty military personnel and U.S. Postal Service workers).",
      "The longstanding guidance is that \"employees who are performing emergency work involving the safety of human life or the protection of property\" remain on their jobs during a shutdown. The determination of who works and who doesn't has traditionally been made by senior executives and legal advisors at each agency.",
      "This means that the president, as the head of the executive branch, could theoretically order which federal workers must continue to show up for work, said Stan Collender, a budget specialist at the consulting firm Qorvis MSLGROUP.",
      "During a shutdown, national parks typically shut their doors, government-funded scientific research is halted, and various health and safety inspections by agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration are put on hold. (Some government functions are not reliant on congressional appropriations, and these can usually continue unimpeded in the face of a shutdown.)",
      "But workers responsible for human safety and security will typically remain on the job, and that includes many members of the military.",
      "How the military is affected",
      "Active-duty military personnel have always been required to work through shutdowns. Army troops don't abandon their posts and naval ships don't all return to port. In addition, many civilian workers in the Defense Department have been required to work through shutdowns.",
      "Other civilian workers in the Defense Department, however, hold jobs that do not meet the urgency threshold to keep working. In 2013, the government furloughed about half of its civilian workers, or about 400,000 employees, leaving a patchwork of various permissible and impermissible activities, according to Federal News Radio.",
      "\"We can and will continue to support key military operations,\" former Defense Department comptroller Bob Hale told Federal News Radio in 2013. \"We're allowed to do that by law, but the law would force us to disrupt many of our support activities. We wouldn't be able to do most training, we couldn't enter into most new contracts, routine maintenance would have to stop, and we couldn't continue efforts to improve contracting and financial management including our audit improvement efforts.\"",
      "The Defense Department, like other parts of the government, will experience some consequences from a shutdown. But experts we interviewed agreed that Trump's language in this tweet amounted to an exaggeration, especially because the Defense Department is hurt less by a shutdown than most agencies.",
      "\"All critical military functions will continue,\" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. \"There would be some wrinkles, but nothing like other areas of government.\"",
      "Todd Harrison, a defense budget specialist with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the \"biggest impact is probably on defense contractors, who will have to stop working.\" But \"troops that are in harm's way overseas will continue operating as normal and won't be at any increased risk,\" he said.",
      "Paychecks could be delayed",
      "One way that even active-duty troops could feel the shutdown is in their wallets.",
      "Employees who are required to work are not paid until a new spending bill is passed effectively working for free, at least temporarily. Workers who are furloughed have historically been compensated for back pay through subsequent congressional action, though there is no requirement that such a bill be passed. In 2013, the Office of Management and Budget estimated that $2.5 billion in pay and benefits was paid for hours not worked government-wide, said Tyler Evilsizer, research manager for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",
      "Usually, paychecks have been sent after a shutdown is over, but for the Defense Department in 2013, Congress and the president agreed to a bill in the middle of the shutdown that paid all active-duty and many civilian Defense Department employees. This enabled Defense Department employees to return to work while the shutdown was still going on for workers in other departments.",
      "Delayed paychecks are just one downside of government shutdowns.",
      "\"A shutdown is a huge waste of taxpayer dollars, disruptive of government operations, and simply bad management,\" said John Palguta, a former federal human-resources official who is now an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Public Policy Institute. \"A shutdown, however, will not put the U.S. in harm's way by shutting down our military.\"",
      "Even just planning contingencies for a possible shutdown divert time and effort from the government's duties, said Mallory Barg Bulman, vice president of research and evaluation at the Partnership for Public Service.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Trump said that in a government shutdown, \"what they are really doing is shutting down our military.\"",
      "This is an exaggeration. Based on historical precedent, the Defense Department does stand to see a substantial fraction of its civilian workers furloughed, and employee morale would likely suffer if paychecks are held back. But experts agreed that core military functions would remain operational, including all active-duty military personnel and many essential civilian workers.",

      "From Saltillo to Warren",
      "Saltillo, Mexico, is a nexus of Fiat Chrysler production. It has five plants in the area, doing everything from building engines to assembling finished vehicles. Over 4,000 workers at its truck assembly plant turn out several variations of the Ram truck line.",

      "The company's spokesman in Mexico, Miguel Ceballos, told reporters and the company's American press office confirmed that the automaker expected no change in the number of Mexican workers.",
      "So under the plan, the United States gains workers and Mexico holds steady.",
      "Kristen Dziczek, an economist at the Center for Automotive Research, a government-and-industry-financed research group in Ann Arbor, Mich., told us the move doesn't mean Fiat Chrysler is leaving Mexico.",
      "\"The plant in Mexico stays open,\" Dziczek said. \"Chrysler has a very profitable truck product and only two plants in the United States where it makes them. This allows them to retool while keeping production rolling so they can avoid down time.\"",
      "The move is part of Fiat Chrysler's longer term shift away from making cars to making trucks and SUVs in the United States. In 2016, Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne told investors, \"By the time we finish with this, hopefully, all of our production assets in the United States will be producing either Jeeps or Ram.\"",
      "The company's press office said over 90 percent of Ram trucks are sold in America. Industry experts note that trucks are more profitable to Fiat Chrysler than cars.",
      "The last 200 model, a passenger car, rolled off the assembly line at Fiat Chrysler's Sterling Heights, Mich., plant in 2016. Soon after, the company announced that facility, not far from the Warren plant, would start making Ram trucks.",
      "Marchionne credited the recent tax bill for spurring the latest move. He also argued it was the \"right thing to do\" given that Ram trucks had always been made in the United States.",
      "But concerns over the fate of NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, might well have played a role too. Under NAFTA, pickup trucks made in Mexico face no tariff when they cross the border. If NAFTA is scuttled, the tariff would shoot up to 25 percent.",
      "Dziczek noted that moving truck assembly to the United States is a hedge against that risk.",

      "The Mexican plant will start making another kind of vehicle, and the company expects no change in the number of workers.",

      "President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that more than 20 people have migrated to the United States due to family ties to a terror attack suspect.",
      "A man drove a truck onto a bike lane and pedestrian walkway in Manhattan on Oct. 31, killing eight people and injuring 12 others. The suspect, Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, is an Uzbek national whom Trump has singled out as a reason why \"chain migration\" and a visa lottery program should end.",
      "\"This man that came in or whatever you want to call him brought in, with him, other people He was the point of contact the primary point of contact for and this is preliminarily 23 people that came in, or potentially came in with him. And that's not acceptable. So we want to get rid of chain migration, and we've wanted to do that for a long time,\" Trump said Nov. 1.",
      "Trump offered a lower number as he discussed the terror suspect with the Wall Street Journal on Jan. 11: \"So the lottery has to end, chain migration he brought in, they say, 22 people through the chain. So we have 22 of his relatives, why?\"",
      "Two days earlier during a meeting on immigration with bipartisan lawmakers, Trump said it was \"22 to 24 people came in through him.\"",
      "We wondered if Trump was right: have at least 22 people come to the United States due to familial links to Saipov?",
      "Neither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security provided information to substantiate Trump's claims. A State Department spokesperson told us that visa records are confidential under immigration law, preventing comment on the details of individual visa cases.",
      "Experts told us Trump's figures are improbable.",
      "Saipov, from Uzbekistan, entered the United States in 2010 through the diversity visa lottery program, which admits up to 50,000 people per year from countries with low levels of immigration to the United States.",
      "Applicants for the diversity program are able to include in their application their spouse and unmarried children under 21 years old.",
      "That is not what happened with Saipov, who arrived in 2010. Multiple news outlets reported that Saipov got married in the United States in 2013 to a woman who already lived here, also an Uzbek national. Their three children were all born in the United States. The family lived in Paterson, N.J.",
      "\"Unless Saipov had 22 unmarried, under-age-21 children at the time he came here, President Trump's statement that Saipov brought 22 people with him is clearly false,\" said Stephen H. Legomsky, an emeritus professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis who served as chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2011 to 2013.",
      "Once in the United States, green card holders, such as Saipov, are only able to petition their spouse and unmarried children.",
      "We have not seen any reports of 29-year-old Saipov fathering more than 20 kids before he left Uzbekistan and petitioning for them to come to the United States since his arrival.",
      "Generally, is it possible for one green card holder to bring in 22 or more relatives?",
      "\"It may be possible, but it's very unlikely,\" said Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute working with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program. \"Theoretically, if someone had many foreign-born children, and those children had many children, they could sponsor one spouse, plus 21 children and grandchildren. The grandchildren would come as derivatives of their children.\"",
      "But that would be far above the average rate of family sponsorship, Gelatt said.",
      "A 2013 study found that overall, each new immigrant sponsored an average of 3.45 family members.",
      "As the New York Times and Washington Post's Fact Checker have noted, if Saipov were a U.S. citizen (he's not) he could have petitioned his parents and three sisters to join him. There's no waiting period for parents, but brothers and sisters of adult U.S. citizens fall under a \"fourth-preference\" immigration category. As of Nov. 1, 2017, there were 2.3 million people in that category waiting for a visa, with a waiting period of over 13 years.",
      "The categories of family members that can be petitioned for admission are greater for U.S. citizens, who can additionally bring in parents, siblings, and married sons and daughters and their spouses and children. U.S. citizens can also petition a fiance(e) to come on a visa, and eventually file for a green card after marriage.",
      "Another immigrant accused of a separate attack, Akayed Ullah, \"benefited from extended family chain migration\" when he came to the United States from Bangladesh in 2011, DHS said. Ullah, accused of setting of a pipe bomb inside a New York City subway terminal, is also a green card holder.",

      "\"There is a cooling and there is a heating and I mean, look it used to not be climate change it used to be global warming,\" Trump said in an interview broadcast Jan. 26. \"That wasn't working too well, because it was getting too cold all over the place. The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now, but now they're setting records, so okay, they're at a record level.\"",
      "We looked at what's been going on with the polar ice.",

      "Researcher Julienne Stroeve with the National Snow and Ice Data Center said Trump's claim was \"odd.\"",
      "Stroeve said polar ice is at \"a record low in the Arctic (around the North Pole) right now and near record low in the Antarctic (around the South Pole).\"",
      "The National Snow and Ice Data Center gathers data under contracts with NASA, the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "For both the Arctic and Antarctic ice caps, the extent of the ice is down from the 30-year average. The key difference between the two polar zones is that the levels have bounced around more in Antarctica. This chart, based on National Snow and Ice Data Center numbers, shows the yearly averages back to 1979.",
      "In no way are the ice caps at record highs.",
      "Physicist Kent Moore at the University of Toronto said the satellite record going back to 1979 is well validated and reliable. For the Arctic ice certainly, but also broadly for the Antarctic too, Moore said \"there is variability from year to year but the long-term trend is downwards.\"",
      "Moore did note though that some climate models are predicting a slower rate of loss than scientists have seen in the past.",
      "The White House press office pointed to a 2015 NASA report that found ice was forming in parts of Antarctica at a faster rate than it was being lost in other areas of the continent. In other words, there was a net increase in the ice mass on the continent.",
      "But a full reading of the report showed that the gains were slowing down and researchers said that in 20 to 30 years, losses would outstrip gains.",
      "We note that the study is not directly comparable to other data because it measures the ice in tons, while historically, researchers have tracked how far the ice is spread out, that is, its area, not its weight. Moore and Stroeve said the area measurements are more reliable because the observational data has been gathered over many decades. More accurate volume measurements have only recently come on line.",
      "Moore said recent work at the University of Washington suggests that even in terms of volume, the amount of polar ice has been falling.",
      "Trump said that the ice caps are at record levels. They are not. The numbers show that the extent of the ice at both poles is smaller than it was decades ago. The shrinkage is more striking in the Arctic, but the overall trend is downward at both ends of the earth.",

      "President Donald Trump said his administration would slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the United States, the latest in a series of moves to reorder the country's trade arrangements along lines Trump believes are more favorable to American interests.",
      "The Trump administration has long criticized China for flooding the U.S. market with cheap commodities, and the 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum Trump announced March 1 seemed calculated in part to rein in what the administration considers unfair Chinese trade practices.",
      "But some critics, like Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, have charged that a steel tariff would do more harm to U.S. allies like Canada, and American small businesses, than it would do to China.",
      "Following Trump's announcement, King said he heard complaints from constituents who run steel-reliant small businesses. King said one business owner reported an 8 percent increase in steel costs, and another worried about cost increases on steel imported from a nearby Canadian partner.",
      "While Trump may have a point about unfair trade practices, King said, Beijing would hardly bear the brunt of an import tax on steel, given its relatively small U.S. market share.",
      "\"China, my understanding is, supplies 4 percent of the steel in the U.S,\" King said during a March 4 interview on NBC's Meet the Press.",
      "So how much does China account for U.S. steel imports? We decided to mine for answers.",
      "Measuring U.S. steel imports by country is not as straightforward as it might seem.",
      "The American steel industry has argued that China has a backdoor to U.S. markets through a practice known as transshipment, whereby countries buy Chinese steel and modify it before exporting to the United States.",
      "Trump drew attention to this practice during March 6 remarks at the White House.",
      "\"If you talk China, I've watched where the reporters have been writing 2 percent of our steel comes from China. Well, that's not right. They transship all through other countries,\" Trump said. \"It doesn't look good when it all comes out of China, so they send it through other countries, and it comes to us. And it's putting our steel mills out of business.\"",
      "Experts we spoke to said there's no hard data on transshipment, which makes the scale of this practice difficult to gauge.",
      "Edward Alden, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted the Commerce Department was unable to quantify the problem in a recent investigation known as a Section 232 report that probed the effect of steel and aluminum imports on U.S. national security. The report said only that an \"unknown portion\" of Chinese steel is further processed in third-party countries before entering the United States.",
      "\"It's at least fair to say that the president is making a strong claim without solid evidence to back that claim up,\" he said.",
      "Alden added that the biggest targets of Trump's steel tariff would be the European Union, Japan, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Korea. (The White House is reportedly considering granting an exemption Canada and Mexico.)",
      "\"Except for Korea,\" he said, \"none of the others seems to be a transshipment concern.\"",
      "Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the amount of Chinese steel that enters the United States through transshipment is not enough to call into question the reliability of the Commerce Department's import data. He also pushed back on how Trump characterized transshipment.",
      "\"China sells raw and semi-finished steel to other countries, which then make more highly valued products. (But Trump's use of) the word 'transshipment' implied that the same piece of metal arrives, for example, in Veracruz and then is shipped to Houston with no transformation,\" Hufbauer said. \"This is Trump's imagination.\"",
      "So let's set the issue of transshipment to one side and focus on the steel products the Trump administration has eyed for tariffs.",
      "According to Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the only steel imports subject to Trump's proposed tariffs are those which have been identified by the Commerce Department. The department measures U.S. steel imports in two ways: quantity and U.S. dollar value.",
      "Under each yardstick, China's share is relatively small.",
      "In terms of quantity, China accounts for just over 2 percent of U.S. steel imports, according to 2017 data. That's far behind traditional U.S. allies like Canada (roughly 18 percent), the European Union (about 21 percent) and South Korea (nearly 10 percent).",
      "Expressed another way, the United States imported 740,126 tons of steel from China last year, compared to nearly 5.7 million tons from Canada and just over 5 million tons from European Union countries.",
      "",
      "",
      "China's share is slightly larger in terms of dollar value, but still relatively small. The United States imported just shy of $1 billion in Chinese steel in 2017, or 3.35 percent of the United States' nearly $30 billion annual steel import market, according to Commerce Department data.",
      "",
      "",
      "An aide to King pointed us to an interview with Bown, of the Peterson Institute, from September 2017, in which Bown said 4 percent of U.S. imports of steel come from China. But its proportion of U.S. steel imports, relative to other countries, has shrunk since then.",
      "In any case, he wasn't too far off China's 3.35 percent market share in 2017, in terms of dollar value.",
      "Experts largely backed up his broader point about the limited impact of steel tariffs on China.",
      "\"The numbers show that the tariffs will hurt trading partners which are allies much more than China,\" said Mac Destler, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland.",
      "Tom Orlik, chief Asia economist at Bloomberg in Beijing, wrote that China's total exports of steel and aluminum are equal to about 0.5 percent of GDP, with most of that from steel.",
      "\"Relative to fears from Trump's campaign trail rhetoric, in which he threatened an across-the-board 45 percent tariff on all imports from China, these measures are extremely limited,\" Orlik wrote of Trump's proposed tariffs.",
      "King said, \"China, my understanding is, supplies 4 percent of the steel in the U.S.\"",
      "There are different ways to measure U.S. steel imports by country. In terms of dollar value, Chinese steel made up 3.35 percent of the United States' nearly $30 billion annual steel import market in 2017. But in terms of quantity, China accounted for just over 2 percent of U.S. steel imports that year.",
      "King's claim tracks closely to one of two measures. But in either case, King does not stray too far from the Commerce Department's 2017 data.",

      "\"One of the most disturbing displays of Obama's lack of foreign policy expertise came during last year's YouTube debate,\" Hannity said Oct. 26, 2008. \"The junior senator from Illinois gave what many called a naive answer for a question from the audience about whether he would meet with the leaders of Syria, Venezuela, Cuba or North Korea without preconditions.\"",
      "Asked during that debate if he would be willing to meet with those leaders without preconditions, Obama said \"I would,\" and compared that to previous presidents.",

President Trump is accepting an invitation to meet with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un by May, and Pyongyang is agreeing to stop all nuclear and missile tests while these talks are underway. And the sanctions? They will continue.\"",
      "So the text in the image matches what Hannity said.",

      "Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned!",
      "But for North Korea, denuclearization applies to the entire peninsula, which has implications for the American presence and military posture in South Korea. That is not the same as simply agreeing to a North Korea without nukes.",
      "DeThomas said testing halts are customary during talks with North Korea. Beyond that, North Korea made no concessions or took any steps toward ending its nuclear program.",
      "Trump has imposed stricter sanctions and has been more ready to hint at using military force against North Korea. But in terms of having direct talks between the leaders of both nations, DeThomas said this administration set a lower bar than what previous presidents have demanded.",
      "\"The Trump precondition for talks was that North Korea had to halt nuclear and missile testing for some unspecified period of time prior to commencement of talks,\" DeThomas said. \"",
      "In February, Vice President Mike Pence drew headlines when he said sanctions and direct talks could happen at the same time.",
      "To some observers, that meant the administration was willing to talk without the precondition of North Korea agreeing to a future free of nukes. DeThomas characterized such words as \"loosey goosey,\" but not indicative of a major change.",
      "In that regard, when Hannity praised Trump, the administration's overall policy was tougher than what Obama had articulated when he ran for president. But the fact remains that Trump had agreed to a meeting before North Korea had taken any concrete steps toward ridding itself of nuclear weapons.",

In 2018, Trump's administration voiced some relaxation on preconditions, but not a full rejection of them.",

      "As the National Rifle Association sees it, the March For Our Lives taking place in Washington and in cities and communities nationwide, is a ploy to destroy the Second Amendment. On NRATV, host Grant Stinchfield said he is \"committed to exposing the violent, even deadly history of these people behind this weekend's March For Our Lives, anti-gun fraud of a protest.\"",
      "\"March For Our Lives is backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions,\" Stinchfield said March 21.",
      "The key evidence behind that claim?",
      "Stinchfield argued that the Women's March, the massive protest the day after the inauguration of President Donald Trump in January 2017, is \"a major force behind\" the March For Our Lives.",
      "He further argued that the Women's March organization is run by radicals with violent tendencies. Stinchfield's first example: Singer Madonna telling a crowd that she felt so frustrated after the election that she \"thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.\" (\"But I know that this won't change anything,\" she quickly added.)",
      "We explored the facts behind each link in that chain of association. The organization behind the March For Our Lives defies easy description, but one thing is clear: As an organization, the Women's March is not a big player.",
      "The NRA broadcast mentioned Tamika Mallory, a Women's March national co-chair.",
      "\"She has nothing to do with this,\" said Allan Mayer, co-CEO of 42West, the public relations firm for March For Our Lives.",
      "The NRA listed another Women's March co-chair, Linda Sarsour.",
      "\"Absolutely no connection to what we're doing,\" Mayer said.",
      "NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam pointed to an article on Bustle, a news, entertainment and beauty website, describing how the youth engagement arm of the Women's March was promoting gun control activism. That's true. The youth organizers have posted a detailed gun control policy including a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. They promoted the National School Walkout protest in mid March and provided a toolkit for young organizers who wanted to hold their own local events.",
      "But their website has only a single mention of the March For Our Lives. It is the 14th point on a page about the school walkout and says \"We will be at #March4OurLives too!\" It adds, \"It will take sustained action to end gun violence and we stand in solidarity with our peers who are also organizing around gun violence prevention.\"",
      "The clearest link to the Women's March comes in the person of Deena Katz, a producer of Dancing With the Stars and a co-executive director of the Women's March Los Angeles Foundation. Through a personal connection to a family in Parkland, Fla., the site of the deadly school shooting, Katz stepped in early to work with the student activists at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.",
      "Katz applied as an individual for the permits to march in Washington. She is the president of the March For Our Lives Action Fund, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit established to fund the march and future lobbying on gun control.",
      "But Mayer at 42West said Katz is doing this on her own, separate from the Los Angeles Women's March group. A spokesperson for the LA group told Buzzfeed in February that the organization itself was not involved.",
      "The march has been a magnet for the many advocacy organizations that have pressed for gun control over many years. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and Sandy Hook Promise all promote the march.",
      "Two organizations, Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords Courage to Fight, are playing a prominent role in organizing sibling marches around the country and providing logistical muscle for the main march in Washington. Everytown along with its grassroots organizing arm Moms Demand Action has funded local marches, and maintains an interactive map showing where they are taking place.",
      "Everytown for Gun Safety receives significant support from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Giffords Courage to Fight emerged after the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School and is the project of gun victim and former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., and her husband Mark Kelly.",
      "The liberal activist group MoveOn and Planned Parenthood also actively support the march. Planned Parenthood lists 14 local marches on its website.",
      "The Episcopal Diocese of Washington is coordinating housing and meals for out-of-town visitors.",
      "March For Our Lives has had no trouble securing hefty donations from Hollywood stars, companies and philanthropists.",
      "George and Amal Clooney pledged $500,000, a sum that was quickly matched by Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw, and others.",
      "The Italian fashion company Gucci gave $500,000, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff pledged $1 million, as did billionaire philanthropist Eli Broad.",
      "The march also raised more than $3 million online through a GoFundMe campaign.",
      "The NRA said that the March For Our Lives is \"backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions.\" That allegation rested on the idea that the Women's March played a major role in the march, and the NRA host mentioned two co-chairs by name.",
      "We found no evidence that either the organization or those people are directly involved in the march. The Women's March website doesn't even list the gun control march as an upcoming event.",
      "The only significant tie between the marches is a producer who leads the Los Angeles chapter of the Women's March. But the chapter said it is not involved, and the producer has acted on her own to apply for permits and establish the March For Our Lives' nonprofit support fund.",
      "Major organizational muscle behind the march, both in Washington and in cities nationwide, comes from two well-known gun control advocacy groups, neither of which has a history of violent behavior. A number of related organizations have lent their support, including the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, and celebrity donors have given millions of dollars.",
      "The NRA claim is without merit. We rate it Pants on Fire.",
      "Correction: After we published, a reader noted that the Youth Empowerment FAQ page on National School Walkout included a reference to the March For Our Lives. The fact-check has been corrected to reflect that reference.",
      "We also updated the story to reflect Madonna's full quote from the 2017 Women's March."

Americans racked up billions in purchases of everything from Chinese-made communications and computer equipment, to kitchen appliances and shoes.",
      "Based on trade in goods, Trump's $500 billion figure is off by $125 billion.",

      "When you factor that surplus into the two countries' overall trade balance, the United States ran a roughly $336 billion deficit with China last year which means Trump's figure was off by about $164 billion.",
      "It's possible Trump may have confused the Chinese deficit with the United States' overall trade deficit, which was $566 billion in 2017, according to the bureau.",

      "We decided to take a closer look. Is the United States third in murders, and are a few outlier cities responsible? That's false by any standard.",
      "The main study of intentional homicides is performed by the United Nations' Office of Drug Control. The UN warns against cross-national comparisons because of the differences in legal definitions of intentional homicides and recording practices.",
      "Our count of the UN's data placed the United States ninth in intentional homicides. We used the most up-to-date count for each country and territory, which included data anywhere from 2007 to 2015.",
      "As the country with the third-highest population size, however, experts told us the number of people killed is not a very useful metric.",

      "When we counted only the countries for which the UN had 2015 data, the United States ranked 73rd. That's still far from the top ten.",
      "The meme argues that a few outlier cities with stringent gun control legislation are responsible for the United States' high homicide count. But that's not true, either.",
      "Chicago, Detroit, Washington, St. Louis and New Orleans have homicide rates well above the national average, but that's typical for large urban cities.",
      "While Detroit, St. Louis and New Orleans are consistently among the top five American cities by homicide rate, the cities with most per-capita murders vary from year to year. Neither Washington, D.C., nor Chicago make the top five.",
      "Chicago has a high number of homicides because of its population, but its homicide rate is middle of the road for large U.S. cities, according to Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at the University of Central Florida.",

And without those cities, the homicide rate (per capita) would only decline by 7.73 percent, or from 5.34 to 4.93.",
      "When we applied those reductions to the UN data, the United States barely budged in its international standing. It moved down four spots in per capita murders and stayed the same in total murders. That's inconsequential compared with the 186-spot jump the meme concocted.",
      "Gun control laws are mostly controlled by state legislatures. Washington, D.C., is the only listed city able to enact strict ordinances, while Chicago can do some things, according to Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.",

Historians generally agree it was founded by a handful of Confederate veterans in Pulaski, Tenn. as a social fraternity and it quickly changed into a violent group that terrorized newly empowered black and white Republicans in the South.",
      "J. Michael Martinez, the author of a 2007 book \"Carpetbaggers, Calvary and the KKK,\" told us many angry Southern whites during the 1860s and 1870s were Democrats and a smaller number of them joined the KKK.",

      "Carole Emberton, an associate professor of history at the University at Buffalo, wrote in an email that various \"Klans\" that sprung up around the South acted as a \"strong arm\" for many local Democratic politicians during Reconstruction. Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest -- believed to be the KKK's first Grand Dragon -- even spoke at the 1868 Democratic National Convention, said Emberton, author of \"Beyond Redemption: Race, Violence and the American South after the Civil War.\"",
      "But Emberton added a major caveat:",
      "\"The party lines of the 1860s/1870s are not the party lines of today,\" she wrote to us. \"Although the names stayed the same, the platforms of the two parties reversed each other in the mid-20th century, due in large part to white Dixiecrats' flight out of the Democratic Party and into the Republican Party after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By then, the Democratic Party had become the party of reform,' supporting a variety of liberal' causes, including civil rights, women's rights, etc. whereas this had been the banner of the Republican Party in the nineteenth century.\"",
      "Elaine Frantz Parsons, an associate professor at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh said that most post-Civil War southern whites were Democrats who were unhappy with Republican policies on Reconstruction while large numbers of newly-freed slaves were Republicans.",
      "\"So it is not surprising that the Reconstruction era Klan would have been very largely Democrats attacking Republicans,\" Parsons said in an e-mail. \"But this simply does not map well at all onto the party structure we know today. Among other things, the Republicans (during Reconstruction) were condemned as the party of big government and as wanting to centralize authority on the federal level.\"",

      "Several wine industry analysts told us that when calculating a winery's size, the best measure is not the acreage of vines that have been planted - it's the volume of wine produced. By that standard, wine experts told us there's no way Trump Winery is the biggest on the East Coast.",

      "In fact, by that measure Trump Winery is not even the largest in Virginia. The Trump Winery produces about 36,000 cases of wine each year, according to Boyd. The top producers in the state are the Williamsburg Winery and Chateau Morrisette in Floyd County -- each making about 60,000 cases a year, Boyd said. Barboursville Winery in Orange County, meanwhile, makes about 37,000 cases a year, Boyd said.",
      "It's not hard to find wineries along the East Coast that make even more. Duplin Winery in Rose Hill, N.C., produces about 390,000 cases of sweet wine a year, Dave Fussell Jr., Duplin's president, told us in an email.",
      "Duplin, on its website, claims to be the \"largest winery in the South.\" Its grapes come from more than 1,000 acres, the vast majority from farmers who grow them off-site.",
      "The Biltmore Winery in Asheville, N.C., says on its website that it produces about 150,000 cases of wine a year.",
      "Lastly, we wondered whether there are wineries on the East Coast that have more grapes than Trump Winery's 200 acres of vines. The answer is yes.",
      "The Wagner Vineyards Estate Winery in the Finger Lakes region of New York says it cultivates 250 acres of grapes (and makes 50,000 cases of wine a year). The vineyard manager at Pindar Vineyards on New York's Long Island said in a November 2015 interview that its vineyard has more than 300 acres of grapes. Pindar says it makes 70,000 cases of wine a year.",

      "Berry also is among the seven candidates in the mayor's race. He's held a number of key administrative posts in the Richmond region but never has held elective office. So we wondered if he had, indeed, voted to cut millions from city schools, as Stoney said.",
      "Footnotes on Stoney's flier base the claim on an April 17, 2012, article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch that updated a funding feud between Mayor Dwight C. Jones and the city's School Board.",
      "The controversy began in February 2012, when the board passed a school budget with $263.7 million in projected expenses but only $239.9 million in projected revenues.",
      "Rather than cut expenses, the board opted to approve its underfunded budget and ask Jones and the Richmond City Council to make up the difference.",
      "Jones responded in March by appointing a task force of 11 public and private executives to look for savings in the School Board's budget that wouldn't hurt classroom instruction. Berry, a former Richmond budget director, was one of the appointees.",
      "The panel hired two outside consultants, including former Richmond City Manager Robert C. Bobb, to find possible short- and long-term cuts. The consultants' $35,000 fee was paid by the Greater Richmond Chamber Foundation.",
      "On April 16, 2012, the panel voted 10-1 to recommend $23.8 million in cuts to the School Board's proposed budget. Berry voted with the majority.",
      "An article in the next day's Times-Dispatch - footnoted in Stoney's flier - said the task force \"leaned heavily\" on the consultant's recommendations in finalizing its list of proposed cuts. The list included:",
      "cutting 20 teacher positions;",
      "cutting 25 teacher aides;",
      "cutting 50 non-teacher positions;",
      "imposing three furlough days;",

      "changing the structure of plant service and security; and",
      "eliminating the employee bonus pool.",

To the contrary, the article cited by Stoney says the task force \"heavily leaned\" on the recommendations of its consultants in finalizing its list of proposed cuts. It also should be noted that Berry was not one of the two people Jones appointed as co-chairmen of the panel.",
      "A week later, Jones asked City Council to contribute an additional $5.1 million for education - far below the extra $23.8 million the School Board sought. The mayor rejected the task force's recommendations for furlough days and eliminating health benefits for the school system's pre-Medicare retirees. The council increased that amount to $5.6 million.",
      "In the end, Richmond schools were left with a $250 million budget for the 2012-13 school year, anchored by a $129.4 million appropriation from the City Council and with the rest coming from state and federal sources. That was slightly higher than the $249.1 million for the 2011-12 school year, which included $123.8 million in city funds.",
      "Our ruling",
      "Stoney's flier says, \"Jack Berry voted for a plan to cut $23.8 million from our schools.\"",
      "The Richmond School Board passed a budget in 2012 that exceeded its revenues by $23.8 million and asked the city to make up the difference.",
      "Mayor Jones refused and appointed an 11-member advisory committee, which included Berry, to find savings. The panel voted 10-1, with Berry's support, to recommend a plan that itemized $23.8 million in cuts to the board's proposed budget. The City Council largely adopted that plan.",
      "Stoney's statement suggests that Berry had an official role in the budget deliberations. He didn't. Berry served as an adviser to the mayor with instructions to find efficiencies. He didn't have a say in the actual appropriation of city funds for education; that remained in the hands of the City Council.",
      "It's also misleading to say, as Stoney does, that the plan \"cut\" $23.8 million from schools. Most of that sum was hoped-for new money from the City Council that the School Board never received.",

      "Priebus' statement goes beyond foreign government contributions to the Clinton Foundation, leaving the impression Clinton herself may have benefitted from money donated by the four countries -- including Yemen, which is the home of one of al-Qaida's most active branches, and where the United States has conducted airstrikes since 2009.",
      "Let's sort it all out.",
      "Clinton Foundation",
      "Not only Republicans are raising questions about whether the Clinton Foundation is taking millions of dollars a year from governments and other donors that want political influence. The Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, Politico and CBS News have run stories about the questions, with a Journal analysis noting that the number of governments contributing to the foundation in 2014 appeared to have doubled from the previous year.",
      "Responding to Priebus' claim, the foundation emailed us a statement saying: \"Like other global charities, the Clinton Foundation receives support from individuals, organizations and governments from all over the world because the foundation's programs improve the lives of millions of people around the globe.\"",
      "The charity, originally named the William J. Clinton Foundation, was launched in 2001 by former President Bill Clinton. Its aim is to partner with government and non-government organizations to tackle issues such as AIDS and poverty. The foundation has received millions of dollars from foreign governments, as PolitiFact National found in February 2015 when it rated that claim by a conservative group as True.",
      "When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009, under President Barack Obama, the foundation agreed to disclose its donors at the request of the White House. When she left the Cabinet post, in February 2013, the foundation became the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, with Hillary Clinton taking an active role in fundraising.",
      "Clinton resigned from the foundation's board just before announcing her candidacy. And a few days later, the foundation announced it would modify its policies while she is a candidate for president, limiting which governments can give directly to the foundation.",

      "The U.S. and Oman have been parties to a military cooperation agreement since 1980. Oman \"plays an important role in helping the United States realize its regional stability goals\" in the Middle East, the State Department says.",
      "Morocco",
      "Four days before Clinton announced her run, Politico reported that the foundation was accepting at least $1 million from a Moroccan government-owned company to hold a high-profile conference in May 2015 in Marrakech with the king of Morocco.",
      "The article noted that in 2011, Clinton's State Department had accused the Moroccan government of \"arbitrary arrests and corruption in all branches of government,\" but that when she announced the conference in September 2014, she praised Morocco as \"a vital hub for economic and cultural exchange.\"",
      "The U.S. regards Morocco as a \"strong partner in counterterrorism efforts,\" according to the State Department.",
      "Yemen",
      "Neither the Post nor the Politico articles, which were cited to us by Priebus' office, reported any donations to the foundation from Yemen. And a spokesman for the foundation told us the country has never been a donor.",
      "Yemen borders Saudi Arabia and Oman, but unlike those countries and Morocco, is not a monarchy. American drones have been conducting strikes in Yemen since 2009.

      "While Trump appeals to emotions, Ryan tends to be cast as the GOP's policy wonk.",
      "But in a July 9, 2016 New York Times article, the chairman of the University of Wisconsin's political science department suggested Ryan's reputation may be overblown.",
      "Why? Few of his plans ever become law.",
      "\"(Ryan) has actually proposed three total, three bills that have become law in his entire career dating back to 1999,\" David Canon was quoted as saying. \"Paul Ryan is not a detail kind of legislator in terms of putting bills together to pass, and he never has been.",
      "\"He is an ideas guy.\"",
      "When Ryan announced his endorsement of Trump, he wrote that the first step in setting policy agenda is \"putting it on paper and having a real debate.\"",

      "Bills, bills, bills",
      "The article listed three bills proposed by Ryan that became law:",
      "\"One named a post office in Wisconsin, a second changed taxes on arrows used by deer hunters, and the third, this year, established a $3 million presidential commission on evidence-based policy making.' \"",
      "A visit to Ryan's profile at Congress.gov shows when filtered by \"Sponsored Legislation\" and \"Became Law\" the same three bills referenced in the article.",
      "While Canon was quoted as saying Ryan proposed only three bills, he told us he was referring to bills \"sponsored\" by Ryan.",
      "\"Sponsoring a bill is very different than co-sponsoring a bill,\" Canon wrote in an email. \"Many bills that become law have a hundred or more cosponsors, so bill sponsorship is the meaningful indicator of the member of Congress who had primary influence on determining the content of a bill.\"",
      "According to Congress.gov, Ryan has sponsored 109 pieces of legislation and co-sponsored 1,067. Of those, 83 became law.",
      "New York Times reporter Jackie Calmes said it was clear from their conversation that Canon was referencing sponsored bills, and the statement's context in the article reflects that.",
      "But Ryan's camp challenged how Canon assessed Ryan's tenure.",
      "\"Any realistic look at (Ryan's) record will clearly show the claim that Paul has only passed three bills is objectively wrong,\" said spokesman Ian Martorana.",
      "He references three particular items not included in the count, all of which Ryan helped write:",
      "Murray-Ryan Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013",
      "Trade Promotion Authority legislation in 2015",
      "Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, in which Ryan authored disability insurance reforms",
      "For four years, Ryan also chaired the House Budget Committee, which wrote and passed a nonbinding resolution each year, Martorana said.",
      "Jennifer Victor, a professor of political science at George Mason University and an expert on Congress, said while Ryan has only personally sponsored three bills that became law, bill passage is not necessarily a good indicator of effectiveness as a legislator.",
      "\"Some legislators may be very active in a policy area, but rarely see enactment,\" she wrote in an email. \"Think of someone who introduces many bills, perhaps symbolically, and they all die in committee or get voted down on the floor.\"",
      "While this legislator hasn't changed the law, he or she might have generated attention for a topic.",
      "Measuring impact based only on the bills a lawmaker solely sponsors also introduces issues, Victor said. Early cosponsors can be heavily involved in the bill's content and committee chairs, while they don't necessarily write more bills, often serve as facilitators.",
      "A better indicator of effectiveness, Victor said, is a tool developed by two professors that measures a lawmaker relative to his or her peers.",
      "It takes into account the content of a lawmaker's bills and how far the bills moved. Policy bills, for example, increase a lawmaker's score more than commemorative bills. But it only looks at solely sponsored bills, which does not necessarily give the full picture of a lawmaker's impact.",
      "By this tool, Ryan comes off as more effective, though his effectiveness is below the benchmark expectation for all but one two-year period since 1999.",

      "Trump won Wisconsin by 27,000 votes. 300,000 voters were turned away by the state's strict Voter ID law. There is your \"rigged\" election.",

      "But it's worth noting, with the emergence of fake news, that the figure isn't pulled out of thin air.",
      "The law, and lawsuits",
      "In 2011, the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature adopted and GOP Gov. Scott Walker signed a law requiring residents to show a photo identification in order to vote. A drivers license, state ID card, passport and other forms of ID were among those that would meet the law. Voters could request a free state ID for voting from the state Department of Motor Vehicles.",
      "(Wisconsin is one of seven states with a so-called strict photo ID law, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Eight other states have a photo ID law that's labeled as non-strict.)",
      "The same year, and again in 2012, various groups filed lawsuits. After a two-week trial, U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman in 2014 struck down the law. The Milwaukee judge said the requirement that voters show photo IDs at the polls established an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote and violated the federal Voting Rights Act because its effects hit Latinos and African-Americans harder than whites.",
      "As part of his ruling, Adelman determined that about 300,000 registered voters in Wisconsin -- about 9 percent of all registered voters -- lacked the type of identification needed for voting. He said his finding was based primarily on expert testimony from Leland Beatty, a statistical marketing consultant in Texas who was hired by the plaintiffs. Beatty, the judge wrote, estimated the number of registered voters who did not have a drivers license or state ID card.",
      "After more litigation, the law was eventually reinstated in 2015.",
      "2016 election",
      "So, how many people were turned away in the 2016 presidential election for lack of photo ID?",
      "In Wisconsin, according to the state Elections Commission, there were 2,975,313 votes cast for president in 2016 (prior to the recount), down 93,121 votes or 3 percent from 2012.",
      "The Milwaukee election director said the drop of 41,000 included \"some of the greatest declines\" in areas \"we projected would have the most trouble with voter ID requirements.\" He also acknowledged, however, that some of the drop-off had to do with the candidates and less enthusiasm for the candidates.",
      "But no statistics are kept on the number of people who were turned away at polling locations on election day for lack of photo ID.",
      "In any case, it's almost certain the figure is not 300,000.",
      "Adelman himself noted that although he found the voter ID law would \"deter or prevent a substantial number\" of the 300,000 from voting, \"a more precise measurement is impracticable. There is no way to determine exactly how many people (the law) will prevent or deter from voting without considering the individual circumstances of each of the 300,000 plus citizens who lack an ID.\"",
      "Political scientist Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us: \"There is no evidence that 300,000 people were turned away in the November 2016 election. We will never know the precise impact of the voter ID law on turnout. It is almost certainly not true that all 300,000 or so people who are registered but lack ID tried to vote this year.\"",
      "Simply put, while it's likely that some voters were turned away at the polls, others no doubt obtained a photo ID and cast their ballots.",
      "Snopes.com, which in its fact check of this statement issued a rating of \"unproven,\" concluded that \"even if the 300,000 figure was an accurate estimate of Wisconsin residents who back in 2014 possibly could not vote because they did not have the correct identification, that number was not a head count of residents who actually did or would have set out to vote on Nov. 8, 2016, only to be turned away.\"",

Tax deductions -- on health insurance, pensions and investment returns, for example -- allow corporations to reduce the pool of taxable profits.",
      "Indeed, a March 2016 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that in each year from 2006 to 2012, at least two-thirds of all active corporations had no federal income tax liability, although larger corporations were more likely to owe tax.",

      "But that's a long way from $100 million.",
      "If you think you've heard that figure before, perhaps it was from a February 2016 report by the Wall Street Journal. It estimated that since Clinton and former President Bill Clinton entered national politics in the early 1990s, Wall Street has contributed more than $100 million to their political campaigns, charitable foundation and personal finances.",

Bachmann (now a Trump campaign adviser) asked for an investigation, citing information that claimed Abedin's mother, brother and late father were \"connected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations.\"",

The column said that from 1996 to 2008, Abedin was an editor at the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs working under her mother, Saleha Abedin, who remains editor-in-chief. The column called the journal \"a radical Muslim publication that opposed women's rights and blamed the US for 9/11.\"",

      "Clinton \"gave up 20 percent of America's uranium supply to Russia -- to Russia,\" Trump said Sept. 28, 2016, two days after their first debate. \"You know what people do with uranium, don't you? It's called nuclear. Twenty percent. They could have never done it without her.\"",

      "The uranium deal",
      "Before we get too far ahead of ourselves -- the United States gave a fifth of its uranium to Russia? What?",
      "Uranium is used to power commercial nuclear reactors that produce electricity and to produce isotopes used for medical, industrial and defense purposes around the world.",
      "As for the transaction Trump alluded to, it involved the Russian nuclear agency and Uranium One, a Toronto-based company.",
      "As PolitiFact National has reported, Russia's nuclear energy agency, which also builds nuclear weapons, bought a controlling stake in Uranium One. The company has mines, mills and tracts of land in Wyoming, Utah and other U.S. states equal to about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity.",
      "So, to be clear, the 20 percent is capacity, not uranium that has been produced.",
      "Given that Russia doesn't have the licenses to export uranium outside the United States, it was likely more interested in Uranium One's assets in Kazakhstan, the world's largest uranium producer, our colleagues said.",
      "As the New York Times has reported, the deal was made in separate transactions from 2009 to 2013. It made Russia's atomic energy agency one of the world's largest uranium producers and brought Russian President Vladimir Putin \"closer to his goal of controlling much of the global uranium supply chain.\"",
      "U.S. involvement",
      "So, what was Clinton's role?",
      "Since uranium is considered a strategic asset, with implications for national security, the deal had to be approved by a committee composed of representatives from a number of United States government agencies.",
      "At the time, the United States was seeking to \"reset\" its relationship with Russia and trying to get the Kremlin on board with its Iran nuclear deal.",
      "The national security issue at stake in the Uranium One deal was not primarily about nuclear weapons proliferation, the Times reported, because the United States and Russia had for years cooperated on that front, with Russia sending enriched fuel from decommissioned warheads to be used in American nuclear power plants in return for raw uranium.",
      "Instead, it concerned American dependence on foreign uranium sources. While the United States gets one-fifth of its electrical power from nuclear plants, it produces only around 20 percent of the uranium it needs.",
      "Trump's claims",
      "Now, back to what Trump said.",
      "Trump's previous claim on the topic, made in June 2016, was that Clinton's State Department \"approved the transfer of 20 percent of America's uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.\"",
      "PolitiFact National rated it Mostly False -- mainly because there is no evidence of a quid pro quo.",
      "As for Trump's current claim, it's overstated.",
      "The State Department did approve the Uranium One deal, but it didn't act unilaterally. It was one of nine U.S. government agencies, plus independent federal and state nuclear regulators, that had to sign off on the deal.",
      "And as FactCheck.org noted in a related fact check, while any of the nine agencies could have objected to the deal, only President Barack Obama had the power to veto it.",

      "A boast Gov. Scott Walker made in his weekly radio address on March 23, 2017 sounded like one he'll repeat -- if he runs for re-election in 2018, which is widely expected.",
      "After his standard, \"Hi, Scott Walker here\" greeting, the second-term Republican declared:",
      "\"Wisconsin's economy is in the best shape it's been since 2000.\"",
      "It's a bold, broad claim.",
      "Is it right?",
      "The measures",
      "On the radio, Walker backed his claim with one of his favorite statistics -- the state's unemployment rate. It had just dropped to 3.7 percent in February 2017, the lowest since November 2000.",
      "Though important, the unemployment rate is but a single measure of the economy. When we asked for any other information to support the claim, his staff primarily cited declines in overall tax burden, income taxes and property taxes, saying \"a competitive tax environment sets the stage for economic growth and simply allows households to keep more of their own money.\"",
      "But taxes are more a measure of the health and size of government, not how well the economy is doing. Indeed, when we asked six Wisconsin economics professors for advice on how to evaluate Walker's claim, none cited any tax-related measure.",
      "With guidance from the experts and other sources, we settled on these six measures:",
      "Unemployment rate",
      "Labor participation rate",
      "Average weekly wages",
      "Average income for top earners vs rest of the population",
      "Gross domestic product per capita",
      "Poverty rate",
      "We'll address them two at a time.",
      "Unemployment and employment",
      "Unemployment rate: Percentage of people in the labor force -- the civilian population ages 16 and older -- who are unemployed.",
      "Unemployment in Wisconsin was low in 2000 and it's low again.",
      "The rate generally rose from 2000 to 2003, then dipped from 2003 to 2008, before peaking at around 9 percent in the second half of 2009 and early 2010. Since, then has steadily declined.",
      "Walker was correct in saying that the 3.7 percent rate in February 2017 was the lowest monthly rate since November 2000. (It was as low as 3.2 percent in January and February of 2000).",
      "Labor participation rate: Percentage of the population that is either working or actively seeking work -- excluding people such as college students and retirees.",
      "The labor participation rate is important because it takes into account people who are unemployed plus so-called discouraged workers -- those who are unemployed and not looking for work.",
      "The figures show labor participation in Wisconsin is declining.",
      "During 2000 and into 2001, the rate generally rose a bit, hitting 73.3 percent in March 2001.",
      "But since then, it's been on a downward slope, hitting 68.3 percent in February 2017. That means fewer people are in the workforce.",
      "The takeaway: Unemployment backs Walker's claim; labor participation does not.",
      "Wages and income",
      "Real average weekly wage: What a person (in the private sector) is paid for working, adjusted for inflation, including not only regular wages but pay such as bonuses.",
      "Wages in Wisconsin have generally been on an upward trend.",
      "The figures are reported quarterly, but since they tend to vary by season (summer vs winter, for example), we looked at annual numbers.",
      "On that basis, the average weekly wage rose from 2000 to 2004, and then rose and fell until 2011. Since then it's been on the rise, hitting $896 in 2015, the last year for which annual data are available. That's higher than any year going back to 2000.",
      "Income distribution: How much more income is earned by people near the top of the scale versus the rest of the population. Income includes not only wages, but also money from sources such as investments and welfare benefits.",
      "In Wisconsin, the gap between people near the top of the income scale and the rest of the population is growing.",
      "We compared the average income of a person in the top 10 percent versus a person in the bottom 90 percent -- in other words, people near the top versus the rest of the population, taking inflation into account.",
      "In 2013, the latest data available for this comparison, the annual income for the average person in the top 10 percent was $234,916. That's 6.7 times more than the average income in the bottom 90 percent, which was $35,102. That ratio has generally increased since 2000, when it was 6.0.",
      "The takeaway: Average wages back Walker's claim, since they're up; but income distribution doesn't, given that the gap is growing between the relatively few people on the top end of the scale and everyone else.",
      "Productivity and poverty",
      "Real GDP per capita: Total value of goods and services produced, divided by the population and adjusted for inflation.",
      "Gross domestic product per person in Wisconsin, taking into account inflation, rose from 2000 to 2006, dropped from then until 2009, and has been on the rise since.",
      "The latest figure, for 2015, showed real GDP at $46,893 per person -- higher than any previous year going back to 2000, when it was $41,911.",
      "Poverty rate: Percentage of people below the official poverty threshold.",
      "Poverty is calculated based on a person's income from sources such as wages, Social Security and child support, as well as from \"cash\" government benefits such as public assistance and unemployment insurance. The poverty threshold for 2015, the most recent year available for this comparison, was $12,082 for a single person and $24,257 for a family of four.",
      "In Wisconsin, the poverty rate has trended upward.",
      "The 2015 rate was 11.4 percent. That's higher than every year going back 2000 except for two (12.4 percent in 2004 and 13.1 percent in 2011).",
      "The takeaway: GDP helps Walker's claim; poverty does not.",
      "Summing up",
      "As we've noted in previous fact checks, governors have some impact on a state's economy, but many other factors, including national trends, are at work. In this instance, Walker didn't explicitly take credit for what he says is a better economy, though he implies it.",
      "The economists we consulted see some improvements and some declines in how Wisconsin's economy is now compared to 2000.",
      "\"The economic portrait of Wisconsin since 2000 is mixed at best,\" said Lawrence University's Merton Finkler. \"Clearly, the Wisconsin economy is not as dynamic as some others, such as Minnesota's. Part of the reason is that it has done a relatively poor job of encouraging startup enterprises, which tend to grow employment faster than larger and older firms.\"",
      "Said Andrew Reschovsky at the University of Wisconsin-Madison:",
      "\"A growing economy is characterized by rising real per capita GDP and rising real wages. This growth is to be expected, and reflects increased labor productivity over time. Although Wisconsin's economy is larger now than it was in 2000, the fact that the poverty rate is higher and that there is growing income inequality indicates that the benefits of our growing economy have gone mainly to those with the highest incomes.\"",
      "Our rating",
      "Walker said: \"Wisconsin's economy is in the best shape it's been since 2000.\"",
      "The latest figures for the unemployment rate, wages and gross domestic product support Walker's claim. But the figures for labor participation rate, income and poverty do not.",
      "For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True."

      "On his first visit to Wisconsin since taking office, President Donald Trump came to Kenosha, a city once synonymous with manufacturing, to sign an executive order as part of his \"Buy American, Hire American\" agenda. It's aimed at boosting jobs in the United States.",
      "Speaking April 18, 2017 at Snap-on Inc., a tool manufacturer, Trump made a claim about China. He implied it had a hand in the loss of American jobs, saying:",

And you've seen that, you've heard about it -- 70,000. The World Trade Organization -- another one of our disasters.",

      "Some of that decline is due to China's becoming a bigger player in the world economy by joining the WTO, as our colleagues reported:",
      "Around the same time China joined the WTO, the United States gave China permanent normal trade relations status. Both of these actions removed significant barriers to trade and investment with China, basically putting them on an even playing field with the United States' other trading partners. In the 16 years since, United States imports from China have quadrupled, in large part because production is so cheap there, making U.S.-based manufacturers less competitive. We found three significant economic studies from the past few years that all conclude increased free trade with China has had a negative impact on American manufacturing and jobs.",
      "At the same time, experts said the loss of factories was also brought on by other factors, including U.S. trade deficits with other parts of Asia and Europe; a slow recovery after the Great Recession; and increased manufacturing productivity in the United States.",
      "The Trump-O-Meter, which tracks Trump's campaign promises, shows Trump has pledged to reverse China's entry into the WTO.",

      "Trump said: \"We've lost 70,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization.\" The latest U.S. Census figures, for 2014, produced two counts: 73,000, which supports Trump's claim, and 61,000. And at least some of the losses can be attributed to increased trade with China.",

      "Visiting the Badger State for the first time as president, Donald Trump made a claim about steel and the proposed Keystone XL pipeline that is similar to one his staff has already had to correct.",
      "While in Kenosha on April 18, 2017 to give a speech touting his \"Buy American\" agenda, Trump said in an interview with WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee:",
      "I support the concept of everything from the U.S. You know, I don't know if you saw, but I approved a pipeline, right, called the Keystone pipeline, and other pipelines. And I want them to use American steel, American product. I want it manufactured here. And I made those changes just before we signed it. I said, Where's the steel coming from? So, all pipelines that are coming into this country from now on has to be American steel, which is really a big factor.",
      "So, while mentioning the Keystone, which still needs approvals before it can be built, Trump is claiming \"all pipelines that are coming into\" the United States have to be made with American steel.",
      "The Keystone XL",
      "Proposed by energy giant TransCanada, the 1,179-mile Keystone XL would transport more than 800,000 barrels of oil per day from Western Canada to Nebraska. Then it would connect with an existing pipeline system to refineries on the Gulf Coast, where the oil would be turned into petroleum products such as gasoline. The refineries export about two-thirds of their products; the rest is sold in the United States.",
      "The project had been in limbo for more than seven years when the company's application to build the pipeline was rejected in November 2015 by President Barack Obama. He said the pipeline wouldn't serve U.S. national interests and would undercut America's global leadership on climate change.",
      "In contrast, Trump promised during the 2016 presidential campaign that he would build the Keystone and get \"a piece of the profits\" -- a pledge that's been rated In the Works on PolitiFact's Trump-O-Meter.",
      "An important step was taken in March 2017 when, at Trump's urging, the State Department issued a presidential permit for the Keystone. The permit is necessary for the pipeline to cross the U.S.-Canadian border. But before the pipeline can be built, it must win approval from the Nebraska Public Service Commission and local landowners.",
      "The steel connection, meanwhile, relates to a memorandum regarding construction of American pipelines that Trump signed in January 2017.",
      "Keystone and steel",
      "The memorandum calls for U.S oil pipelines to use American steel in their construction -- but it is not an order carrying strict requirements.",
      "The memo directs the secretary of commerce to \"develop a plan under which all new pipelines, as well as retrofitted, repaired, or expanded pipelines, inside the borders of the United States,\" use materials and equipment produced in the United States, \"to the maximum extent possible and to the extent permitted by law.\"",
      "Five weeks after Trump signed the memorandum, the White House stated explicitly that it does not apply to the Keystone XL.",
      "White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that because the Keystone is not a \"new\" project, it is not bound by the memo. \"But I know that everything moving forward would be -- fall under that (memorandum),\" she said.",
      "(The White House didn't provide us any information to back up Trump's claim.)",
      "While carrying the weight of the president's signature, the memorandum has the force of law only over the executive branch of the federal government. (And for that matter, it is arguably a lesser form of presidential action than an executive order.)",
      "Moreover, as Reuters has reported, the memorandum contains \"legal language about ordering things to the maximum extent permitted by law, which is designed to preserve lots of wiggle-room\"; and the attempt to mandate the use of American steel \"would almost certainly violate 70 years of settled international trade law.\"",
      "Chris Weld, a Washington trade lawyer whose firm represents American steel companies, told the Washington Post that the memorandum is not a mandate, but rather \"a message to U.S. pipeline operators to consider steps to purchase U.S.-produced iron and steel.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Keystone, while not yet under construction, is nevertheless well under way.",
      "TransCanada has said it already has purchase agreements for the 660,000 tons of steel it will use for the Keystone XL. Half is to come from the Arkansas plant of an India-based steelmaker, 10 percent from a plant in India and the rest imported from Canada and Italy.",
      "Trump, meanwhile, reportedly will sign an executive order directing the Commerce Department to investigate whether steel imports into the United States should be blocked on national security grounds.",
      "Our rating",
      "While mentioning the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, Trump said: \"All pipelines that are coming into this country from now on has to be American steel.\"",
      "The White House made it clear weeks earlier that a memorandum signed by Trump related to the use of American steel does not apply to the Keystone -- only to new pipeline projects.",

      "\"I think for the most part the state has shown significant improvement in terms of both perception and its business climate\" since Walker took over, said Gigerich, who has helped locate sites for 300 projects, including about 25 that considered Wisconsin. \"Wisconsin is not one of the lowest-cost states to do business in, but it is one that is now competitive, where I think a decade ago Wisconsin struggled with its tax structure and economic incentive programs.\"",
      "Several site selectors pointed to the creation of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation as a step in the right direction, though they noted the state is still being held back by its aging transportation infrastructure.",

      "When U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan describes repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, he gives the signature legislation of President Barack Obama a damning assessment.",
      "Here's a typical version, from his weekly press briefing on Jan. 5, 2017:",
      "\"We're going to get this law repealed, we're going to get this law replaced, and we're going to have a transition period so that people do not have the rug pulled out from underneath them while we get to a better place. Obamacare has failed, is getting worse, and we have to provide relief. And we will have a transition period so that people don't get hurt.\"",
      "Ryan earned a Mostly True rating for his November 2016 claim that Obamacare \"is not a popular law\" -- though it's worth noting that a January 2017 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading nonprofit research group on health care, found a split, with 49 percent saying Congress should repeal the law and 47 percent saying Congress should not.",
      "Our rating was False when the Wisconsin Republican in January 2017 said Obamacare \"is in what the actuaries call a death spiral,\" given that conditions didn't match the definition of what is an established term.",
      "But perhaps no Ryan attack on the law has been as audacious as \"Obamacare has failed,\" a declaration he has made several times. He even went so far as to say on Jan. 27, 2017 that it is \"basically a spectacular failure,\" though three days later he went softer, saying in a tweet: \"For many Americans, it has already failed.\"",
      "So, let's put Ryan's claim to the test.",
      "There are many ways, of course, to evaluate the Affordable Care Act, which became law in 2010 though many changes were phased in later. But two of the major ones are coverage (Do more people have health insurance?) and costs (How much do you pay for insurance and what does it cover?)",
      "\"There were things that succeeded and there things that didn't go as planned,\" said Donna Friedsam, health policy programs director at the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute.",
      "Said economist Gail Wilensky, a senior health and welfare adviser to Republican President George H.W. Bush: \"To say it's a failure is problematic because it requires a more nuanced answer.\"",
      "This table highlights some of our findings. It's followed by a more detailed analysis.",
      "Coverage",
      "Costs",
      "20 million Americans gained health insurance",
      "Total health expenditures grew at record low rates in first three years after Obamacare",
      "8.9% of Americans did not have health insurance in 2016, down from 16% in 2010",
      "Employer plans: Family premiums up 99% under George W. Bush, 59% under Barack Obama",
      "Millions no longer at risk of being denied coverage due to pre-existing conditions",
      "22% in 2017 in cost of the average mid-level Obamacare plan",
      "\"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it\": 2013 Lie of the Year",
      "Cut the typical family's health insurance premium up to $2,500: Promise Broken",
      "The coverage",
      "More gained coverage: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that during the first six years of Obamacare, 20 million Americans gained health insurance as a result of the law -- a figure acknowledged by Donald Trump's administration. Similarly, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected in January 2017 that a 2015 bill that would have repealed key portions of the law would have increased the number of uninsured by 18 million in one year.",
      "On a related note, the President's Council of Economic Advisers credits the law for what it says is a one-third drop nationally since 2010 in the share of Americans reporting that they have forgone medical care due to cost.",
      "Fewer are uninsured: As one might expect, far fewer people are uninsured. Defending Obamacare during the 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton said a record 90 percent of Americans had health insurance. PolitiFact National rated that True. A month later, in November 2016, a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, based on its annual survey, found 8.9 percent of Americans did not have health insurance in 2016. That was down from 16 percent in 2010, the year the ACA was passed.",
      "How it's been done: The 20 million who have gained insurance includes people covered through the law's expansion of Medicaid, the creation of the Health Insurance Marketplace, where individuals buy policies, and changes in private insurance -- one that allows young adults to stay on their parents' insurance plans and one that requires insurers to cover people with pre-existing health conditions.",
      "When former GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina said in a Milwaukee debate in December 2015 that \"Obamacare isn't helping anyone,\" she earned a Pants on Fire. At the time, 10 million people had been put on Medicaid as a result of Medicaid's expansion under the law; and 9.5 million were enrolled in policies bought on the marketplace (including 8 million who were receiving subsidies under the law).",
      "In addition, the law as it stands now has meant millions of Americans are no longer at risk of being denied coverage due to pre-existing conditions (a Promise Kept for Obama); or are no longer at risk of being kicked off policies for developing expensive medical conditions.",
      "Broken promises: It's worth noting that the gains in coverage have not all gone as planned. Obama and others had said repeatedly about the ACA -- \"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it\" -- and that became PolitiFact National's 2013 Lie of the Year. Obamacare rules were strict, so that even if existing plans deviated a little, the plans were not grandfathered in under the law, and by the fall of 2013 insurers canceled coverage for millions of Americans.",
      "\"Access to a no-frills' plan is a huge improvement on what low-income people experienced prior to the marketplaces,\" said a Vox critique of the ACA. \"But it's still a far cry from what health wonks envisioned just a few years ago when they saw the health care marketplaces reshaping the industry.",
      "Referring to the 20 million, Wilensky, now a senior fellow at Project HOPE, an international health foundation, said of the ACA: \"Saying it's a failure is too harsh because it got that part done.\"",
      "The costs",
      "An Obama pledge made during the 2008 campaign to cut the cost of a typical family's health insurance premium by up to $2,500 a year was rated a Promise Broken. As they have for years, health care costs have continued to increase, but there has been some moderating.",
      "Premiums rising: Premiums have gone up -- a cumulative 11 percent between 2013 and 2016 for the average full-family, employee-sponsored plan; and 38 percent between 2014 and 2017 for Obamacare plans. But the results are mixed, if you consider how much premiums went up before the ACA:",
      "On employer-sponsored plans, family premiums increased by a cumulative 99 percent under the eight years of Obama's predecessor, President George W. Bush, while under eight years of Obama, the increase was smaller -- 59 percent -- according to Kaiser. Kaiser's latest annual employers survey found that the average family premium in 2016 for their plans rose just 3 percent from 2015, while the premium for single coverage stayed essentially flat. That's not to say the premiums aren't substantial: Workers on average contribute $5,277 annually toward their family premiums.",
      "For individual market policies, in the three years before the ACA, premiums rose on average 9.9 percent in 2008, 10.8 percent in 2009 and 11.7 percent in 2010, according to the nonprofit Commonwealth Fund. The higher increases under Obamacare include a projected 22 percent increase nationally in 2017 in the cost of the average mid-level Obamacare plan, which is the most popular choice, though Kaiser says the increase would be as high as 145 percent (for customers in Phoenix).",
      "Critics have also pointed out that people who buy insurance on their own in the federal marketplace have fewer choices. Some major insurers, because they suffered losses, have dropped out of the marketplace, leaving nearly one in five Americans who are eligible for Obamacare with only one insurer in 2017, according to research done by the McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System Reform for the New York Times.",
      "Big picture-wise, total expenditures on health care nationally grew at record low rates in 2011, 2012 and 2013, the first three years after the ACA was adopted, according to the President's Council of Economic Advisers -- even if there is debate over a number of factors as to why. Health care costs are rising much more slowly than they did during the past 50 years, two former Obama health care advisers wrote in the Washington Post. But Wilensky said much of the slowdown can be attributed to the global recession, given that increases in health spending were even lower on average in other industrialized nations.",
      "Deductibles rising: Ryan and other Republicans have said many people feel they don't really have health insurance because their deductibles are so high. It's worth noting that one ACA provision ensures that nearly all Americans with employer coverage have a limit on their annual out-of-pocket spending. But the Kaiser survey of employers found the average deductible for workers covered by an employer plan was $1,221 in 2016, up 13 percent from $1,077 in 2015.",
      "And deductibles can run high for Obamacare plans. In a story headlined, \"Many Say High Deductibles Make Their Health Law Insurance All but Useless,\" the New York Times found that in many states, more than half the plans offered through HealthCare.gov had a deductible of $3,000 or more.",

But health care costs have risen more slowly since the law took effect and the law has met its major goal of getting more people insured -- an estimated 20 million. That's not a failure.",
      "The biggest problem with Ryan's statement is that he, and Obamacare critics, take a nuanced situation and turn it into a black-and-white statement. The same problem would face those who say Obamacare is a great success.",

      "U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has received a lot of criticism (and a False rating from us) for his claims that actuaries say Obamacare is in a \"death spiral.\" But it's far from his only criticism of the former president's trademark health care law.",
      "Ryan has repeatedly brought up rising premiums as well, notably in his Jan. 5, 2017 weekly briefing where he ran off a list of increases for 2017.",
      "\"This law is hurting people right now. I mean, look at these premium increases,\" the Janesville Republican said, then ticked off a series of states.",
      "\"This year Arizona, 116 percent increase in premiums. Tennessee, 63 percent increase in premiums. Oklahoma, 69 percent increase in premiums. Illinois, 43 percent increase in premiums. North Carolina, 40 percent increase in premiums. Nebraska, 51 percent. Pennsylvania, 53 percent. These aren't statistics, these are real lives,\" he said. \"These are real families facing huge premium increases.\"",
      "Are the premium increases Ryan cited correct, \"hurting people right now\" and attributable to Obamacare?",
      "Numbers are on the mark",
      "The basic numbers are easy to confirm: Those increases are indeed accurate for 2017 compared to 2016 within the Obamacare marketplace. Arizona has by far the largest increase in the nation, and Oklahoma is second.",
      "The states all are among the Top 10 in percentage increase over 2016, according to estimates the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released in October 2016.",
      "As such, they are not a representative sample of all 50 states, but Ryan never claimed they were. And they are the headlines in a clear national trend.",
      "Premiums rose an average of 25 percent across the 39 states that use the HealthCare.gov marketplace. Only one state (Indiana) saw premiums drop in 2017.",
      "The calculation is based on the average cost in each county for the second-lowest-cost silver level plan for a 27-year-old, a plan widely used as a benchmark to compare rates between years and geographic areas.",
      "Premiums affect many people",
      "Ryan's description of the law as \"hurting people right now\" is a bit subjective, but it's clear enough for us to examine since he later expanded on this by referencing \"families facing huge premium increases.\"",
      "Obamacare supporters often claim premium increases are irrelevant due to the subsidies built into Obamacare. Those subsidies cap premium prices at a certain percentage of income for anyone below 400% of the federal poverty level (that's $48,240 in 2017 for a single person). For 2017, 81 percent of consumers enrolled in the marketplace through Dec. 24, 2016 were in line to receive a subsidy.",
      "That means 19% of those insured will receive no subsidy and therefore bear the full weight of those premium increases (assuming they stay on the same plan). That's more than 2 million people, based on the latest enrollment data.",
      "Fair to attribute increase to Obamacare?",
      "The final hurdle for Ryan's claim is the matter of blame. He says the law itself is hurting people right now in other words, that increases due to Obamacare go beyond the general trend of rising health care costs.",
      "This year's 25 percent increase is by far the largest since Obamacare began. Premiums rose around 7 percent in 2016 and 3 percent in 2015, based on the HHS analysis of the same benchmark plan.",
      "For starters, that jump is far beyond what is expected industry wide. The National Business Group on Health estimates employees of the nation's largest businesses an indicator of overall health insurance costs will see about a 5 percent premium increase in 2017, based on a survey of 425 large employers.",
      "Obamacare premiums are rising far more in part because of several mechanisms built into the healthcare law that have ended or not worked as intended reinsurance and risk corridors.",
      "Both were set up as temporary measures from 2014 to 2016 to subsidize the marketplace, artificially keeping prices low.",
      "Reinsurance was designed to reduce the incentive for insurers to charge higher premiums to higher-cost policyholders in the first years of Obamacare, which was accomplished by transferring funds to the plans for those policyholders.",
      "Risk corridors were designed to transfer money from profitable insurers to those losing money on the ACA exchange, discourage insurers from setting high premiums due to the uncertainty of the new market.",
      "They were originally pitched as a mechanism that would bring in money, then as one that would break even. But the latest data shows in 2015 claims from insurers for payment through the program outweighed the money paid in by $5.8 billion, so the expected funds weren't available to redistribute.",
      "Now that the programs have ended as designed, premiums are rising to more closely match what it actually costs insurers to offer plans in the marketplace.",
      "This is by no means an exhaustive accounting of the factors driving 2017 premiums upward. Experts say general growth in health care costs still play a role, as do changes in who is signing up, provider networks and the small group market, among others.",
      "Our rating",
      "Ryan said soaring Obamacare premiums are \"hurting people right now,\" including one state with an increase of 116 percent.",
      "The state-by-state increases he cited were correct based on the commonly used benchmark plan. The increases appear likely to affect several million people since about one-fifth of those enrolled in Obamacare aren't eligible for subsidies.",
      "And while we can't exactly identify all the factors in the rising premiums, they are clearly going up more than non-Obamacare premiums due in part to how the system was set up.",
      "The missing nuance in Ryan's claim is that it doesn't acknowledge the millions of people who wouldn't have any insurance without Obamacare and would presumably end up hurting even more. And we'll note some level of financial hurt would exist regardless due to ever-rising cost of health care.",

      "Two days after President Donald Trump temporarily banned certain groups of people from entering the United States, his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, defended the executive order by directing attention to terrorism and Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama.",
      "The protest-triggering order has been criticized as a \"Muslim ban\" (it is and it isn't, we found). But Trump refutes that, asserting that the part of the order targeting seven Muslim-majority countries is aimed at fighting terrorism.",
      "Priebus, a Wisconsin native, appeared Jan. 29, 2017 on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and said:",
      "Here's the deal: If you're coming in and out of one of those seven countries -- by the way, identified by the Obama administration as the seven most dangerous countries in the world in regard to harboring terrorists and affirmed by Congress multiple times -- then you're going to be subjected temporarily with more questioning until a better program is put in place over the next several months.",
      "As we noted in our Muslim ban article, the large majority of jihadists committing acts of terror in America have been American citizens or legal residents.",
      "And since 9/11, no one in the United States has been killed in a terrorist attack by someone from the seven countries, though there have been at least three non-deadly cases in which the perpetrator was connected to Iran or Somalia.",
      "So, were the seven nations that are identified in Trump's travel ban pegged by the Obama administration as the \"seven most dangerous countries in the world in regard to harboring terrorists\"?",
      "Not quite in that way, but Priebus has a point. Trump's order",
      "Trump's executive order has two major components. It suspended entry of all refugees -- those who want to resettle in the United States -- for 120 days and barred refugees from Syria indefinitely. It also prohibits nearly all citizens from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days.",
      "That travel part of the order is a Muslim ban in the sense that most residents of those seven countries are Muslim. But it's not a ban, in the sense that the vast majority of Muslims in the world don't live in those countries and thus are not affected by the order.",
      "A week after the order, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, lifting the ban, although more court action followed.",
      "The Obama connection",
      "The travel part of Trump's order does target the same seven countries that were singled out with a law Obama signed in December 2015.",
      "The Obama-signed law contains provisions that restrict travel to the United States for people who lived in or visited Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria since March 2011. They must have a visa to enter the United States; they can't use what is known as the Visa Waiver Program, which allows 90-day U.S. visits to other foreign visitors.",
      "The law was soon expanded by Obama's Department of Homeland Security to cover Libya, Somalia, and Yemen. They were identified in the agency's announcement as \"countries of concern,\" a phrase used in the law.",
      "Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told us Priebus' claim is not misleading, but that the law Obama signed doesn't define the seven countries as the most dangerous in terms of harboring terrorists. There are other countries where terrorists are active but could have been left off the Obama list for other reasons, he said.",
      "There are countries, such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and others, where militants have significant space to operate, but there could be a variety of reasons why they were not included with countries where travel without visas is restricted by Obama law, he said. For instance, the U.S. government has a delicate relationship with the Pakistani government and there might be a desire on the part of the United States not to restrict travel from people in certain countries.",
      "Two notes before we close that don't directly bear on Priebus' claim, but shed light on the seven countries:",
      "Iran (added in 1984), Sudan (1993) and Syria (1979) are the only countries on the U.S. State Department's list of \"state sponsors of terrorism.\" They were determined by the secretary of state to have \"repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.\"",

And when's the last time we've seen a candidate -- male, female, whatever party -- who has been able to pull together victories that included Utah and Idaho and Louisiana and Maine and Washington and Illinois. I don't think we've seen that. But what we've learned over this year is that hope is making a comeback. It is making a comeback and let me tell you something: For the first time in my adult lifetime, I'm really proud of my country and not just because Barack has done well, but because I think people are hungry for change. And I have been desperate to see our country moving in that direction and just not feeling so alone in my frustration and disappointment.

The email said Podesta needed to change his password immediately in order to protect his account.",

      "\"With another click,\" as the Times put it, \"a decade of emails that Mr. Podesta maintained in his Gmail account a total of about 60,000 were unlocked for the Russian hackers.\"",
      "The trove amounted to what The Guardian called \"an unprecedented window into a presidential run.\" Trump used the emails as fodder for attacks on Clinton -- a number of which PolitiFact National found to need context or misinterpreted what the emails actually showed.",

      "As Republicans in Washington move toward a repeal of Obamacare, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan is doubling down on criticism of the sweeping healthcare law.",
      "That included a description in his Jan. 12, 2017, weekly briefing about the current state of Obamacare.",
      "\"The law is in what the actuaries tell us (is) a death spiral,\" the Wisconsin Republican said. \"So we've got to intervene to prevent this from getting worse.\"",
      "Ryan used the same ominous term death spiral in his Jan. 5, 2017, weekly briefing and as far back as a Fox News interview in December 2016.",
      "But is it accurate?",
      "Death spiral has a precise meaning",
      "The phrase \"death spiral\" evokes an airplane in a nosedive, but in the world of health care it carries a specific definition. Ryan appears to be referring to that definition since each time he used the term, he attributed it to actuaries.",
      "So this isn't a fact check on the health or success of Obamacare, but on whether the present condition is consistent with what industry number-crunchers call a \"death spiral.\"",
      "The term refers to a cycle where shrinking enrollment leads to a deteriorating risk pool (that is, healthy people leave the plan due to the cost). That leads to higher premiums, which causes enrollment to shrink even further, continuing the cycle.",
      "\"It's a well-known and documented phenomenon,\" said David Cutler, a Harvard University economics professor who was among the early users of the term in a 1998 paper, though he doesn't believe he was the first.",
      "Three elements to a death spiral",
      "So a death spiral requires 1.) shrinking enrollment, 2.) a deteriorating risk pool and 3.) rising premiums. Let's look at those one by one.",
      "The latest figures show enrollment in the Affordable Care Act's insurance exchange is up slightly from last year. Through Dec. 24, 2016, some 11.5 million people were signed up for coverage, an increase of 300,000 from the same point last year.",
      "\"This market is not merely stable, it's actually currently on track to grow,\" said Aviva Aron-Dine, an economist with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \"These (death spiral claims) are claims that have been sort of demonstrably false for a while, but it's even more irresponsible to be repeating them now when we actually have enrollment data for 2017.\"",
      "As for the risk pool, Aron-Dine said it improved in 2015. Data for 2016 isn't available yet, but the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reports the share of people signing up for 2017 in the low-risk demographic ages 18-34 is on par with 2016, at 26% of enrollees.",
      "Larry Levitt, vice president of the health care-focused, nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, noted the 26% number in a Jan. 10, 2017, tweet, adding, \"You'd expect that number to go down in an insurance death spiral.'\"",
      "And data maintained by Standard & Poor's shows the pool of people insured through the marketplace is improving, as the insurer cost per enrollee dropped below costs in the employer-sponsored market for the first time since Obamacare began, said Ben Wanaker, deputy assistant secretary with HHS.",
      "The role of premiums is more nuanced.",
      "Premiums are going up significantly this year. The benchmark plan used to gauge changes increased an average of 24% across the 50 states and Washington, D.C., the Kaiser Family Foundation reported.",
      "But most consumers won't see any increase in what they pay because Obamacare includes subsidies that cap premium prices at a certain percentage of income for anyone below 400% of the federal poverty level (in 2016 that would be $47,520 for a single person).",
      "Among the people who have signed up so far for 2017, 81% will receive a subsidy.",
      "As a result, for most there is no direct connection between premiums and enrollment the core connection that defines a death spiral. For example, Arizona has by far the largest premium increase for 2017 (145%) but has still seen Obamacare enrollment increase by 8 percent so far.",
      "\"When the premiums go up, people don't drop coverage because the amount they pay hasn't changed,\" Cutler said.",
      "When asked for evidence of the death spiral, Ryan spokesman Ian Martorana provided links to other people who have claimed the system is in a death spiral and details on how premiums are rising and insurers are leaving the marketplace. But he did not provide any data that showed the conditions being met for the actuarial definition of a death spiral.",
      "None of this is to say things are rosy for Obamacare.",
      "Several of the country's largest insurers have abandoned or drastically scaled back their involvement in the exchanges, meaning one-third of counties will now have only one company offering plans on the exchange.",
      "But that's not a death spiral.",
      "Mark Pauly, a conservative health economist at The Wharton School, said it was a \"poor choice of words\" by Ryan.",
      "\"It's not a death spiral, it's just a downward spiral,\" he said.",
      "Our rating",
      "A death spiral is a health industry term for a cycle with three components shrinking enrollment, healthy people leaving the system and rising premiums.",
      "The latest data shows enrollment is increasing slightly and younger (typically healthier) people are signing up at the same rate as last year. And while premiums are increasing, that isn't affecting the cost to most consumers due to built-in subsidies.",
      "So none of the three criteria are met, much less all three.",
      "We rate Ryan's claim False."

      "Given that the issue of transgender troops may be unfamiliar to many readers, we thought we'd check Pocan's claim that more than 15,000 are serving in the military.",
      "No official data",
      "The Pentagon has said it does not know how many transgender people serve in uniform because until 2016, they faced discharge if they revealed their identities. A Pentagon spokesman did not reply when we asked if the the Pentagon has any estimates. The U.S. Census Bureau also does not collect data on sexual orientation or gender identity.",

The bureau concluded, according to a March 2017 memo, that \"there was no federal data need\" to include those.)",
      "So, there are no official statistics on the number of transgender people in the military. That leaves us with two prominently cited studies that produced estimates which vary.",

      "That study estimated that 15,500 transgender individuals were serving on active duty or in the Guard or Reserve forces.",
      "The study said its primary source was a national survey done by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the National Center for Transgender Equality, which the researchers said was the largest sample of transgender people in the United States available at the time. That survey was conducted over a six-month period starting in the fall of 2008.",

They would not provide more details. Johnson's staff believed the man was acting on his own and the staff was not aware of whether he was involved with Citizen Action or any other group. The behavior led Johnson's office to contact the Capitol Police, which suggested that the letter be sent.

      "To that end, Walker declared: \"We are investing more money into education than ever before in the history of Wisconsin.\"",
      "More money than ever before?",
      "With Walker's budget now before the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee, where it will undergo changes, we wondered if that was the case.",
      "We took a look at the budgets back to fiscal year 1991, which provides about 25 years of data and shows the trajectory before state funding jumped significantly in the late 1990s.",
      "The answer, we found, depends on how you crunch the numbers.",
      "Total state aid vs. inflation-adjusted",
      "For starters, we took Walker's statement to mean K-12 education, not a picture that would include colleges and universities, and the \"we\" to refer to money directly from the state.",
      "That's based on the context within Walker's Feb, 8, 2017, budget address and the K-12 education fact sheet linked from the address itself. And when we reached out to Walker's office, a spokesman pointed us to page 6 of the \"Budget in Brief,\" where K-12 education is addressed.",
      "That page in the briefing document shows that state aid to schools for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 (the years covered by Walker's budget) would be the highest in raw numbers -- at least back to fiscal year 2009, where the chart on the page ends.",
      "The $11.5 billion over the two years would amount to the largest tally in state history. That figure shakes out to $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2018 and $5.9 billion in fiscal year 2019.",
      "But when you compare figures over time, it's important to take inflation into account.",
      "That is, costs grow, prices grow, the economy grows. Adjusting for inflation puts everything on an equal footing.",
      "To get inflation-adjusted state aid, we took the raw numbers from past reports from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau and gathered data back to fiscal year 1991.",
      "We put the figures through the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' inflation calculator and also compared our inflation-adjusted numbers to those run by the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. Both calculations found that fiscal year 2003 was the highest inflation-adjusted year for state aid to schools.",
      "That year, the raw total in state aid was $4.8 billion.",
      "But the tally by the Taxpayers Alliance found that inflation-adjusted state aid that year totaled $6.5 billion. That's far more than the $5.6 billion and $5.9 billion proposed for the next two years in Walker's budget plan.",
      "The bigger picture",
      "Although inflation-adjusted state aid is the best measure, we decided to examine another calculation.",
      "In Wisconsin, state aid doesn't tell the full story in terms of how much money is going to schools. What's known as the \"revenue cap\" imposes a limit on funding by local school districts. That means that without a referendum to exceed the limit, if state aid to schools goes up, local property taxes would go down, leaving a district with the same amount of funding.",
      "At the same time, the state can give schools additional money outside the revenue cap.",
      "\"The revenue limit did not go up the last two years,\" said Dale Knapp, research director at the Taxpayers Alliance. \"However, what they've done is for the past about six years they've been giving the schools money outside the revenue limit.\"",
      "That brings us to \"per-pupil\" funding.",
      "Knapp took the inflation-adjusted total of state aid and property taxes allocated to schools and divided that by full-time equivalent enrollment for fiscal years 1997 through 2017. If you slice the numbers that way, fiscal year 2011 is the highest at $13,112 per student.",
      "That compares to $12,329 in the current fiscal year. The challenge with calculating per-pupil aid is knowing enrollment numbers, which are difficult to predict for 2018 and 2019.",
      "Knapp said even this number comes with another important caveat.",
      "\"Generally, per student funding has risen over the years, even after accounting for inflation,\" he said. \"That it peaked in 2011 is also not a surprise as funding was cut in 2012. However, Act 10 saved districts enough to cover those cuts. Thus, you have to be careful about how you think about that.",
      "\"Essentially, school costs were reset at a lower level in that year, and they have generally been rising since.\"",

      "Undaunted by his party's failure to repeal Obamacare, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin has fixed his sights on the next Republican priority -- tax reform. He says the plan is squarely aimed at helping the middle class.",
      "On Sept. 27, 2017, the day President Donald Trump announced the framework of the GOP tax reform proposal, Ryan did a an interview on the Fox News Channel with conservative talk show host Sean Hannity. In it, Ryan stated:",
      "People who are low- and middle-income, they're the ones who are literally living paycheck to paycheck, who are worried about losing their job or they haven't gotten a raise in years. This is about them and not about people who are really high-income earners getting a break.",
      "Ryan made similar statements about the middle class earlier in the interview, as well as the same day at his weekly briefing with reporters and, repeatedly, several days later on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"",
      "So, is the Republican tax reform framework focused on tax breaks for the middle class \"and not about people who are really high-income earners getting a tax break\"?",
      "What we found are some benefits for the middle class -- but, more clearly, breaks for the rich, as well.",
      "Ryan's argument",
      "When Trump unveiled the framework, the New York Times reported that he offered \"scant detail about how working people would benefit from a proposal that has explicit and substantial rewards for wealthy people and corporations.\" The Times story added: \"Without more details, it is difficult to show how middle-income families will see the most benefit from the tax overhaul or if it will favor the richest Americans.\"",
      "One reason there are questions is that what has been proposed is a framework -- not all of the details have been worked out.",
      "Ryan spokesman Ian Martorana argued that while the plan \"reduces rates for everyone, the wealthiest individuals \"will continue to pay at least the same proportion of the country's taxes.\" He also criticized an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, saying its assumptions about the plan make the analysis \"deeply flawed.\"",
      "Tax Policy Center director Mark Mazur told us he believes the assumptions are reasonable, given that they are based on previous tax proposals outlined by Ryan and Trump.",
      "Key analysis of the framework",
      "The Tax Policy Center analysis found:",
      "The framework would collapse the seven individual income tax rates -- which range from 10 percent to 39.6 percent -- to three: 12, 25 and 35 percent. The higher percentages are applied to those who make more money. Ryan says the current 10 percent rate is reduced to 0 percent.",
      "The framework would also, among other things, increase the standard deduction, eliminate personal exemptions, increase the child tax credit and eliminate most itemized deductions.",
      "So, depending on the details, the provisions could all increase or decrease an individual's federal income tax bill.",
      "One bottom line, according to the analysis: The top 1 percent of earners would receive about 80 percent of the tax benefit. This income group would see its after-tax income increase 8.5 percent, whereas the bottom 95 percent of earners would see an average 1.2 percent increase in their after-tax income.",
      "Other details from the analysis:",
      "In 2018, all income groups would see their average taxes fall, but some taxpayers in each group would face tax increases. Those with the very highest incomes would receive the biggest tax cuts. In 2027, taxpayers in the 80th to 95th income percentiles would, on average, experience a tax increase.",
      "Looking ahead, in 2027, some higher-income taxpayers would pay more in taxes, but the richest would still get breaks. Taxpayer groups in the bottom 80 percent of the income distribution those making less than about $150,000 would receive average tax cuts of 0.5 percent or less of after-tax income. Taxpayers making between about $150,000 and $300,000 would on average pay about $800 more in taxes than under current law. About 80 percent of the total benefit would accrue to taxpayers in the top 1 percent, whose after-tax income would increase 8.7 percent.",
      "The analysis also included this important caveat: The framework does not specify the income brackets to which the individual tax rates would apply, nor the maximum size and phase-out parameters of the increased child tax credit. So, to some extent, projections are hard to make.",
      "But while some in the middle class are projected to see tax cuts, the better-off do even better, according to the Tax Policy Center analysis.",
      "Other analyses",
      "Other think tanks have also had to make assumptions about the framework, given its lack of details. Here is what some of them concluded:",
      "Tax Foundation, a right-leaning group: It's projected the plan \"would, on average, lower the tax burden on the bottom 80 percent of households, while slightly raising the tax burden on the top 20 percent of households. The group with the largest gains is households between the 60th and 80th percentile.\"",
      "New York Times: The proposal \"is a potentially huge windfall for the wealthiest Americans, would not directly benefit the bottom third of the population (and) as for the middle class, the benefits appear to be modest.\"",
      "Washington Post: \"Most people will pay lower taxes, although it's unclear if the rich get a bigger break than the middle class.\"",
      "PolitiFact National: \"The framework appears to favor cuts for wealthier individuals and could increase taxes on some middle class groups.\" Our colleagues reached that conclusion in rating Stalled this campaign promise from Trump: \"Everybody is getting a tax cut, especially the middle class.\"",
      "National Review: \"If they want to avoid raising taxes on a lot of middle-class families while sticking with their framework, Republicans are going to have to plug in the remaining numbers very carefully and probably going to have to expand the child credit by more than $500 per child.\"",
      "Cato Institute, a libertarian-oriented group: \"The problem is that middle-class' Americans pay little in federal income taxes, while lower-income' Americans pay virtually nothing. So Republican leaders are making promises that will be difficult to keep, and they are distracting themselves from the better message of growth and prosperity for all.\"",
      "Again, these analyses emphasized that many details have yet to be filled in.",
      "Finally, it's worth noting that some provisions in the framework specifically benefit the well-to-do, as PolitiFact National found in rating False a claim by Trump that the plan has \"very little benefit for people of wealth.\" The plan would:",
      "Eliminate the alternative minimum tax. This is a calculation that guarantees that certain higher-income taxpayers with large deductions pay at least a minimum amount of tax.",
      "Eliminate the estate tax. Currently, for estates worth more than $5.49 million, the estate is generally 40 percent.",
      "Reduce from 39.6 percent to 25 percent the tax rate for \"small and family-owned businesses conducted as sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations\" -- collectively, these are referred to as \"passthrough\" income. (Ryan argues that most small-business owners in Wisconsin, after business expenses are considered, are middle-class.)",
      "It's worth noting, as PolitiFact New York found, that the framework would increase the number of people who don't have to pay federal income tax, although that's not something that helps the middle class.",
      "Our rating",
      "Ryan says the Republican tax reform proposal is focused on tax breaks for the middle class \"and not about people who are really high-income earners getting a tax break.\"",
      "Missing details in the framework for the tax reform make it difficult to tease out exactly how various taxpayers would fare, so it's possible there will be more for middle-class taxpayers. But based on the framework, while there are some benefits for the middle class, what's more clear is there are specific provisions benefiting the wealthy.",

He held the post from 2002, eventually becoming a favorite of conservatives across the country as he spoke out on national issues, until resigning in August 2017. Then he took his current job, as a senior adviser with the pro-Trump America First Action Super PAC. Clarke had been a surrogate for Trump during Trump's 2016 campaign against Clinton.",
      "CNN reported on Jan. 2, 2018, that days earlier, Clarke was temporarily blocked from tweeting after Twitter user complaints alerted the company that three of his messages violated Twitter's terms of service. Clarke was placed in read-only mode until he deleted three tweets that seemed to call for violence against members of the media.",
      "In one of the deleted tweets, Clarke said:",
      "When LYING LIB MEDIA makes up FAKE NEWS to smear me, the ANTIDOTE is to go right at them. Punch them in the nose & MAKE THEM TASTE THEIR OWN BLOOD. Nothing gets a bully like LYING LIB MEDIA\"S attention better than to give them a taste of their own blood #neverbackdown.",
      "Claim against Clinton",
      "The quote Clarke attributes to Clinton was among those featured in a March 2016 PolitiFact National article that was headlined, \"7 Hillary Clinton quotes on the Internet that are complete fakes.\"",
      "Which doesn't get Clarke's claim off to a good start.",
      "The article said Snopes.com had debunked the alleged quote. The Snopes fact check, originally published in December 2015, rated the quote false, saying:",
      "This statement was not uttered by Hillary Clinton, nor was it published in the 2005 book Rewriting History by Dick Morris as something she ostensibly said. We found no record of this quote in any major publication or news account. In fact, the first mention of this item came in October 2015, more than a decade after Morris' book was published, on a Tumblr page dedicated to generating fake Hillary Clinton quotes.",
